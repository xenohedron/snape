\subsection{Chapter 60: Chapter 60 – Seeking Refuge}

\textbf{What of My Soul, Dumbledore?: Seeking Refuge}

Snape and Draco arrived, in the dim light of the moon rising in its last quarter, at the foot of a long, curving driveway that led yew-lined through iron gates to the shadowy hulk of a great mansion. Snape dragged the terrified Draco to the gates.

"Open them!" he demanded.

Draco obeyed, raising his hand as the wrought iron barrier swung wide in recognition. His grip on Draco not relaxing for an instant, Snape hauled the boy through the gates and along the drive, fear bordering on panic giving urgency to his actions. The two had gone only a short distance along the gravel path when the sound of running feet approached out of the darkness.

"Draco! Draco!" Narcissa's voice, desperate with fright, came to them from a little distance ahead.

"Here, mother!" Draco cried. "Over here!"

"Oh, thank God! Thank God!" Narcissa appeared before them, shimmering in the moonlight, to seize Draco in a fierce embrace. "Severus! What has happened?"

"Draco can tell you," Snape replied, haste clipping his voice to little more than a whisper. "I must go. Now. Whatever happens, be obedient. Be loyal. It's your only defense." The mark on his left arm was already burning. Delay would be fatal. "Goodbye," was all there was time for, and then Snape ran back to the gate, into the lane, and apparated to the Dark Lord.

Hands grabbed him roughly at the entrance to headquarters, binding him, taking his wand, shoving him rudely down the stairs and along the corridor to the interview chamber. Snape didn't resist; his brain was now frantically sorting thoughts, trying to be ready for any question, any accusation, any demand... He was pushed into the tiny circle of light, unable to use his arms for balance, and fell forward, sprawling on his stomach, his head striking the floor with a dizzying thud. He lay very, very still... waiting.

"Where is the boy?" came the high, cold voice. "Where is young Malfoy?"

"With his mother," Snape gasped in reply.

"Why did you not bring him here to me?"

"I didn't want him to witness my punishment."

"Concern for the boy, or concern for your pride?"

"I'm his teacher. You may want me to be his teacher again. If you wish him to see this, he can be brought."

"Why will you be punished?"

"For disobedience."

"Indeed," said the Dark Lord.

The pain started in the pit of Snape's stomach, twisting and wrenching, till it seemed his body was full of malevolent serpents battling to escape through his flesh. He writhed on the floor in agony, his mouth and throat clamped shut by a silencing spell so that he was unable to scream. He shook in helpless convulsions, and then it was over. The pain receded, and Snape lay still again, whimpering on the floor.

"You knew the task was Draco's."

"Yes, Lord." Snape forced his mouth to move, forced the words out.

"You knew, and yet you usurped it for your own glory."

"No, Lord." Pain struck again, blinding fire melting his very bones. This time Snape did scream.

The pain abated, and the cold voice spoke again. "You contradict us?"

"Lord," Snape sobbed, "I did usurp the task, but for hatred's sake, not for glory." Around them a collective gasp revealed the presence of an audience of Death Eaters outside the circle of light.

"Hatred? Of Dumbledore?"

"Yes, Lord. When I came out on that tower and saw him, heard him taunting Draco and your loyal servants... Lord, I could not control myself. I lashed out in anger... and I killed him."

The Dark Lord was silent for a moment. Then, "Bring him to kneel before us," he said.

The hands that grasped Snape's bound arms were not gentle, nor were they as rough in their treatment as before. His handlers had clearly decided it was wise to be neutral. They dragged him forward and settled him on his knees before the Dark Lord, who cupped Snape's face in his hands, thumbs raising the eyelids to force contact.

"Show us," he demanded.

It was, mercifully, a scene that Snape could show in its entirety: his rush to the top of the tower, the circle of Death Eaters around Dumbledore, Dumbledore's plea, and the sudden, spontaneous movement of hand and wand that had destroyed the Dark Lord's great enemy.

"It is good," said the Dark Lord. "Others have shown us the same. Unbind him. Allow him to stand."

Snape stood shakily, rubbing his sore arms and twisted shoulders. He knew he would have bruises on his face from striking the floor, but now at least it seemed he would live. His nerves were strung taut, waiting for the questions.

"So, he is dead."

"Yes, Lord."

"And it was witnessed only by those loyal to us."

"Yes, Lord. I don't think anyone else knew that Dumbledore was on the tower." Snape locked away the knowledge of two broomsticks and an invisibility cloak. There was no reason why he would know about them and he could easily claim ignorance.

"Excellent. Then we may strike now while the enemy is in confusion. Amycus, Alecto, fetch the cabinet here. We are going to Hogwarts."

Snape felt his heart stop beating. He looked about at the circle of Death Eaters as the light grew around his punishment circle. "Cabinet, Lord?"

"So Draco did not tell you. He obeyed us and kept his secrets. It seems we have reason to be pleased with him after all. Severus, there is a Vanishing Cabinet in Hogwarts that is now linked to one in our possession, Mr. Borgin having been persuaded this evening to part with it. From here we may step directly onto the seventh floor of the castle and take over the school."

Snape's brain was racing, but he could think of no way out of the predicament. The twin of the familiar black and gold cabinet was brought into the interview chamber. The Dark Lord smiled. "Amycus, you know the way. You may lead us through."

The lumpy, misshapen Death Eater grinned hideously as he crossed the room to the cabinet, opened the door, and stepped inside. Everyone in the room watched eagerly, but nothing happened.

Amycus stepped out again. "It ain't working!" he exclaimed.

The Dark Lord's anger was not restrained, and Amycus dropped to the floor, twisting in pain. "Fenrir," commanded the Dark Lord. "Get into the cabinet."

One by one, each of the Death Eaters present, including Snape, tried the Vanishing Cabinet, but none was able to transport. "What has happened?" the Dark Lord demanded, his eyes sweeping the room and resting finally on Snape.

"Did anyone see your servants leave the cabinet the first time?" Snape asked.

"No," Fenrir growled after getting a nod from the Dark Lord. "We came out into a storeroom, and the Malfoy brat had a Hand of Glory."

"Did any of your servants fail to return?"

That caused a stir. "Gibbon was killed," Alecto admitted at last. "We don't know where Yaxley is."

"Yaxley was on the tower," said Snape, saying a silent prayer for the welfare of a man he had come to appreciate. "He should have followed us down. My guess is that they realized, or were told, how your servants entered last time, and have disabled the other cabinet."

Fenrir growled at this, but Alecto sidled a little closer to Snape. The mood in the chamber had swung around, especially since Snape, alone of the assembled Death Eaters, was patently innocent of this last blunder. Alecto seemed grateful that someone had provided a reason for failure that deflected the Dark Lord's wrath away from her and her brother.

"Well, well," interposed a new voice, a sultry, deceptively pleasant voice. "So puppy dog is still coming up with answers, even when he..."

"Silence, Bella," said the Dark Lord. "We did not request your opinion. Severus, do you accuse Yaxley of treason, or of cowardice?"

"No, Lord. I believe him loyal to you. But Hogwarts has supplies of Veritaserum, and Yaxley might have had no choice."

Nods around the circle showed the general appreciation of this theory, as it blamed none and even managed to shield the unfortunate Yaxley. Bella, aware of a slackening in her support, pouted and contented herself with glaring at Snape. He himself had no illusions about the fact that she was biding her time.

"Yes," intoned the Dark Lord. "That may be. Go now, all of you. We shall inform you when we have need of you."

They filed out, none daring yet to talk to Snape, but nodding and giving him weak smiles as they separated. Only Bella hung around to chat.

"So you just killed Albus Dumbledore," she said with mock appreciation. "You could have knocked me over with a feather. You could tell even he was pleased, though he couldn't overlook the disobedience. I'll bet Dumbledore didn't look so saintly and calm after a fall like that."

"I don't know," said Snape. "I didn't hang around to look."

"Cleared out as fast as you could, eh?"

"I'd be a fool not to."

"And foolishness is something I'd never accuse you of."

"I think I'll go lie down. It's been a long night." Snape started for the stairs.

"Where will you sleep, puppy dog? You don't have rooms here, you can't go back to Hogwarts, and how soon will it be before they're all over your little hovel in that filthy town?"

Up until that point, Snape had been so concerned about surviving the Dark Lord's wrath that he'd given no thought to anything else, pushing it back into the furthest recesses of his mind. But now, at Bella's prodding, the full import of what had happened that night returned with the force of a sledgehammer. He could never go back. He pushed the thought behind a door and affected calm. "There are emergency quarters for just this kind of situation. Upstairs near the infirmary. I'll use them for the time being."

"Sleep tight," Bella said as he left her and wearily climbed the stairs.

Once in the room, Snape had trouble settling his thoughts, though he knew he had to get some rest or he would never have the strength or the sharpness to continue. \emph{I've known for a year it would come to this. I've had a year to get ready. It was what he wanted. Why can't I accept that and live with it?} It wasn't that simple, though. It would never be that simple. \emph{We weren't ready. For all the talking, arguing, and planning, we weren't ready. When it came right down to that moment, it happened too fast. What am I going to do now?}

Knowing that sleep was impossible, at least for now, Snape lay staring at the ceiling of the little bedroom trying to put his thoughts into some kind of order.

\emph{Do I regret what I did tonight? I regret, I resent, having been forced to do it, but do I regret having obeyed him?} There, at least, Snape could honestly say no. He did not regret having obeyed Dumbledore. The result of his obedience was catastrophic. The result of disobedience would have been worse. Dumbledore still dead, himself dead, Potter probably dead, members of the Order dead, the cabinet pathway to Hogwarts open, Greyback and the Carrows loose in the dormitories of the houses attacking students... It would have been much worse.

The other question returned - \emph{What am I going to do now?} only this time it was focused on the right place. \emph{Dumbledore never told me everything. Worse, he never told Potter everything. The only one who knows what Potter has to do when he faces the Dark Lord is me, but I can't tell it to Potter. Even at the best of times, Potter would never believe me. Now that he watched me kill Dumbledore, he'll be even less likely to. Dear Harry, the man who blasted your mentor off the Astronomy Tower is now asking you to passively allow the Dark Lord to kill you. I know the reception that idea will meet with!}

\emph{And what about here? My greatest value to the Dark Lord was as a spy. I'm no longer a spy, I have no information to give him. All I'm fit for is slave labor in the potions laboratory and self defense lessons. Even if Potter would believe me, how am I ever going to get out of here to tell him?}

After a while though, exhaustion won, and Snape drifted into an uneasy sleep.

"\emph{Here, boy!" she called, her loved voice sultry and enticing. "Want to go for a walk? Does Mommy's puppy dog want to go for a walk?"}

\emph{He ran to her, quivering with excitement, unable to control his wiggling and squirming as he yearned for the door while she patiently fitted him with collar and leash. "There now, all ready. Let's go play a nice game of fetch."}

\emph{The grass was green and cool, and she had so many toys for him to chase and return to her - balls and sticks and magical birds. After a while she pulled another out of her pocket, a thin, straight stick with a long white beard and half-moon spectacles. "Here you go, boy. See if you can bring this one back to Mommy." And she threw it for him, calling out "Fetch!" as her arm went forward.}

\emph{But the stick didn't want to be caught. It swirled through the air while he chased it, teasing him, evading him, luring him away from the grass and from her while she cried, "Puppy dog, come back! Come back! You don't belong to that old thing, you belong to me!"}

\emph{The house was ancient and decrepit, full of dust and strange things crawling under the carpets. "Mongrel!" a fierce voice screamed at him as he entered, still looking for the stick. "Filthy dog, dirtying the rugs! Wanting to sit on decent people's furniture. Get out, you cur!" He almost turned and left, but he had to fetch the stick.}

\emph{He sniffed through the different rooms, but the stick was hiding. A hand parted a veil over one of the pictures, and a sneering voice said, "You housebroken yet, Sniffellus? Or do I have to lay down newspaper?" He tried to escape the voice in the painting, but it followed him all over the house, upstairs and down, flitting from frame to frame. "I don't want you in my house, Sniffellus. I don't care what the stick says."}

\emph{Then he saw the stick. It was in a painting now, too, a painting of a pig on a cliff. And then it was gone. He tried to enter the painting, but it closed around him like jaws, biting, enfolding, suffocating...}

Snape jerked awake to discover that the blanket had twisted over his face giving him the suffocating feeling that had awakened him. He glanced around the room, remembering where he was and why. A feeling of despair washed through him, and then he thought of the dream.

\emph{Grimmauld Place,} he thought. \emph{The Order never uses it anymore. Kreacher's working at Hogwarts. I might be able to get in and out safely. Maybe there's something there that'll give me an idea of what Dumbledore would want me to do now.}

It was around noon. Snape thought about his options, then decided to see if he could just walk out the door. The clerk on duty pushed the ledger book toward him and handed him a quill to sign out.

"What are my restrictions?" Snape asked.

"Didn't know you had any," said the clerk, checking his registers just to be sure. "Nope. You're clear." He frowned and fingered the quill. "You think he might want to find you, sudden like?"

"It's possible," said Snape.

"Where're you planning to go, and for how long?"

"Just getting some air, so some place where there are no wizards. Maybe the Zoo. I can be back immediately if he calls."

And that was it. That simple. Snape walked out of headquarters, into a sheltered doorway, and apparated to within a few streets of Grimmauld Place. A short walk, a few unlocking spells, and then he opened the door and stepped inside. The house was deserted, the air inside it heavy and oppressive with age and mold. It was utterly silent. Snape slipped quietly past the niche where Mrs. Black's portrait hung, tripping over an umbrella stand that he caught before it made any noise. She didn't wake up, and he was relieved. He wanted it to stay silent.

Not knowing where to look or what he was looking for was a problem, but Snape had had enough experience with his dreams to know that one part of his mind was trying to say something important to another part of his mind, and this house had something to do with it.

He started downstairs in the kitchen, then worked his way up to drawing room and parlor. On the way he opened drawers and cupboards, sifted through papers and examined trinkets. He had no idea what he would find, only that when he found it, he would know.

The next place was the bedrooms upstairs. He paused at the first landing, a voice in the back of his brain telling him that Regulus had once mentioned being in a bedroom on the top floor. He decided to try there first, then do the bedrooms on the first landing.

Sirius's room was a shock and a revelation. Motorcycles, Quidditch, and girls seemed to occupy most of his thoughts as a teenager. The place was a riot of posters and photographs with a handful of books and a few papers. Snape began to check all the books, shaking them to see if they contained loose bits of paper between the pages. That was how he found the letter.

It fluttered, both pages of it, from the book in Snape's hand. He bent to retrieve it from the floor and recognized the handwriting instantly. It was like a punch in the stomach. He held a letter to Sirius Black in his hands, a letter that ended with the words 'Love, Lily.' He couldn't breathe. His legs buckled under him and he slipped down awkwardly to his knees on the floor.

After a moment, Snape's breathing returned and his pulse began to slow. He was finally able to focus on the fact that the piece of paper in his hand said something about Grindelwald. It was beginning to sink in that maybe this was not a love letter. That realization made him want to see the rest. The first page had drifted under a chair, and there was a photograph.

It was a thank-you note. Thank you, Sirius, for the birthday present you sent to Harry. Short but chatty, it spoke of Harry's delight with his gift, James's frustration at being pent up, tea with Bathilda Bagshot, and even some news of Dumbledore. Just a simple, friendly, thank-you note.

Grief rose up then for all the little things that Snape could never have. He had said goodbye to Lily on their last day at Hogwarts and had never after been privileged to see or speak to her. Never owned a single photograph of her or heard her light news of tea and birthday presents. Instead he had been led blindfolded into a building in London and had a brand burned into his arm, and all chance at tea and birthday presents ended. He had tried. He had risked death for her, suffered pain for her - it was not enough. She had died not knowing the things he was doing, and today he continued doing them, and she would still never know.

It was with some shock that Snape realized he was crying. That brought him up short in panic and dread. What if the Dark Lord wanted him now? Now while he wallowed in grief and heartbreak. There was no way at this moment that he could completely cover his emotions, and the Dark Lord would read them and know, and everything that had been sacrificed to Lily would from that moment be worthless.

But he couldn't give them up. Having found these precious mementos, he could not force himself to give them up. They belonged to Sirius, but Sirius was dead and no longer needed them. Snape needed them and, remembering his last conversation with Sirius, he sincerely doubted that Sirius would object. The page with the word 'love' and Lily's signature he folded and put into his robes. The picture was of Harry, James, and a laughing Lily. He tore off the image of Lily and tucked it away, too, letting the rest of the picture fall to the floor.

Now Snape began to hurry. He was no longer sure how long he'd been gone from headquarters, and how much time he had before his absence became overlong. He made a quick check of Regulus's room, then hurried downstairs to the bedrooms on the first landing, rummaging in wardrobes and pulling away bed linens. He was interrupted.

"Hey! What are you doing here? This is my family's house, you ruffian!"

Snape jumped, wand instantly in hand, his back to a wall. There was no one there. He glanced around, knowing he was not alone, expecting attack at any moment.

"You sneak thief! You're as bad as that Fletcher person, coming into this house to rob us blind!"

This time Snape got the direction of the voice and looked over to the side of the room. The remonstrations were coming from a portrait of Phineas Nigellus. Carefully he put his wand away. "I'm not stealing," he said. "I'm looking for something."

"A likely story," Nigellus huffed. "What?"

"I don't know. I'll know when I find it."

"Wait a minute..." The portrait was peering at him. "Aren't you the Potions instructor? You are! Wait here, son. Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back." And the portrait walked into the right side of its frame, already calling as it disappeared, "Albus! Albus! I think I found him - the one you want to talk to."

Snape froze, a great sense of release and hope beginning to flood through him. \emph{The portraits! The portraits of the headmasters! Of course. He's still here. Part of him is still here!}

Nigellus returned after a few minutes and Snape demanded, "Where's Dumbledore?"

"Don't talk to me in that tone, young man! Dumbledore can't come here. There's no portrait of him in this house. He does want to talk to you, though. Now listen carefully. His funeral's on Sunday morning. Everyone will be out of the castle. You are to come to the acting headmistress's office on Sunday morning because then you'll be able to talk. Do you understand?"

Snape nodded. "Oh yes, I understand. Tell him I'll be there. I'll definitely be there."

Nigellus left his portrait to return to Hogwarts, and Snape started to straighten the room a little, knowing that he'd found what he'd been looking for. He felt suddenly so buoyant that he was not paying enough attention to the sounds of the house. It came therefore as another great shock when he again heard, "What are you doing here?" Only this time he recognized the voice.

Wand in hand, Severus spun, knowing himself ambushed and unlikely to get off a spell. He found himself with a wand pointed directly at his heart, a wand held firmly in the hand of Alastor Moody.

"You got a lot of nerve coming here," Moody said.

"Don't be too hasty," said Snape, lowering his wand and placing it on the bed, then stepping away from it, hands raised, palms open. "You might not have all the facts yet."

"Let's see if I do," Moody grunted. "Did you kill Albus Dumbledore last night?"

"Yes," Snape replied quietly.

"Seems to me like I got my facts. Can't think of any I'm missing. There's a lot of people want you dead, you know, and while I might not be right at the top of the list, I'm not very far down."

"What are you going to do?"

"The thought had occurred to me to take you to Hogwarts, string you up by your thumbs in Dumbledore's office, and let Harry practice his Unforgivables on you. He's beginning to express a fondness for the Cruciatus curse. I'd be worried if I were you."

"You haven't thought of any more questions?"

Moody cocked his head to one side and let his enchanted eye examine Snape. "Why'd you do it?" he asked finally.

"Dumbledore ordered me to."

Moody barked a short, harsh laugh. "You got to come up with something better than that, Snapey old boy. That's not going to buy you one minute..."

"He also says you have to bring... What do think you're doing?" The portrait voice of Phineas Nigellus rang through the room. "Put that wand down this instant! Albus needs that boy!"

"Who are you?" Moody thundered.

"Who am I? I'll have you know I am Phineas Nigellus, former Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and emissary from Albus Dumbledore to this young man here."

"I don't believe you, you lying Slytherin sneak!"

Nigellus drew himself up in righteous indignation. "We shall see about that!" and he stormed out of his portrait.

A moment later he was back again. "On the day Albus rescued your sorry hide from Barty Crouch Jr.," he announced, "the first thing you said when you woke up in hospital was 'Constant Vigilance,' and Albus told you that sounded pretty foolish coming from a man who let a second rate wizard catch him with his pants down."

There was a moment of silence, then, "Where's Albus?" Moody shouted. "You tell him from me that it's a cheap trick to pretend to be dead and let other people take the fall for it."

"Albus," said Nigellus with great dignity, "cannot leave his portrait in the acting headmistress's office because there is no portrait of him in this house. Now control your temper."

That stopped Moody cold. "You're talking about his portrait in the office? Then he is dead. But you said..."

"He wishes to speak with this young man on Sunday, during the funeral. There is, I take it, unfinished business, and it is the young man's duty to respond and follow instructions. Albus says he has been quite dependable so far."

Moody looked at Snape. "Put your hands down. I'd appreciate it, though, if you let me have a look, and don't go slamming every door you got."

Snape nodded and stood quite still, his eyes open and fixed on the door. Moody came and stood in front of him, the enchanted eye whirling in his head. It wasn't easy to stand passively and allow himself to be probed, but at least this time Snape didn't have to concentrate on what to hide and what to reveal. He just forced himself to stay open, though it was hard.

After several minutes, Moody backed away. "Damn, boyo, I wouldn't have your job for all the tea... He did that to you after you killed Dumbledore?"

"You don't disobey."

"You handed him what he wanted on a platter!"

"You don't disobey. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back. He might send for me, and I want to be able to come when he calls."

"You got any reason you want to come back here?"

"Not that I'm aware of." Snape was puzzled.

"It's just that Fidelius Charms are tricky things, and Moldywart might get ideas that you can lead him places you couldn't lead him before. I want to booby-trap this place against you." At Snape's look of dismay, Moody shrugged. "Look at it this way. You'll have an ironclad reason for not being able to bring him here."

Nothing bad came of Snape's excursion, for the Dark Lord seemed not to have desired to speak to him during all the time he was out, and so never inquired as to his whereabouts. Nor did Bella. Snape was unsure what to make of this, whether it meant he was trusted, or that when the Dark Lord didn't need him, he didn't spare him so much as a thought. In any case, over the next couple of days Snape went out to wander about on more than one occasion, hoping that Sunday morning his foray into the world would meet with no suspicion whatsoever.

It did not. The funeral was at ten o'clock, and by nine Snape was inching his way through the low, narrow tunnel between the Shrieking Shack and the Whomping Willow. At the entrance to the Willow, he looked around carefully, checking particularly that there was no one on the hill. All were, apparently inside. Near the lake, chairs had already been set out for the crowds of mourners.

Slipping from the base of the Willow, Snape scurried into the Forbidden Forest. There he moved north, keeping well in from the edge of the trees, until he was past Hagrid's hut. Then he waited.

He didn't have long to wait. Shortly after nine thirty, the procession started down from the castle. Professor McGonagall led the staff, all in dress robes. The guests from the Ministry of Magic came next, then the students, and then the rest - parents, friends, well-wishers. It took them half an hour to descend the hill and take their places.

When he was certain no one was looking in his direction, Snape left his place of concealment and headed up the hill. The castle was deserted, and Snape's footsteps echoed in the silence. He took the stairs two at a time. On the seventh floor, the gargoyle sentinel let him up the staircase without a password.

Headmasters and headmistresses slumbered peacefully in the dim office. Even though it was what he sought, Snape still felt a pang of shock when he saw Dumbledore's portrait behind the desk - McGonagall's desk now. He coughed slightly. The portrait opened his eyes and looked at Snape.

"Ah, Severus. Punctual as usual, I see," and the sound of the familiar voice lifted Snape's heart as few things had in many long years.

"Yes, Headmaster. You wanted me."

"Indeed. First and foremost, I wanted to thank you for acting your part so splendidly a few days ago. It was hard for you, I know, and yet I also knew that in the moment of crisis you would do what was necessary."

"Thank you, sir."

"Time is brief, Severus, so I must get quickly to the point. Has Voldemort... Oh, I am sorry. Has Riddle filled you in on his plans?"

"No, sir."

"Pity. Listen carefully. Harry has been asked to cooperate and give information both by Professor McGonagall and by Rufus Scrimgeour. He has refused. This means he will be alone through most of his trials, but it also means that what happens in the Ministry or here at this school will have limited power to affect him or alter his course. This is a good thing."

"Sir, if I recall, his course is to die."

"His course is to bring about the defeat of Vol... of Riddle. Do not lose sight of that, Severus."

Snape contemplated the portrait for a moment. "Sir," he asked, "why did you want to talk to me? How does my being here right now help this cause? Do you think I can still pass information on to you?"

"That, unfortunately, will depend upon the course of events. I am a former headmaster, and as such I am bound to assist the current headmaster. Right now it seems I have a great deal of freedom because there is no current headmaster. The Board of Governors should get around to choosing one in July or August."

"What about Professor McGonagall? Doesn't she count?"

"Well yes, of course Minerva counts, but she is not the headmistress. She is acting, but not confirmed. It is a different relationship."

"It doesn't solve anything," Snape muttered. "As soon as there's a new headmaster, I won't be able to see you anymore. Come to think of it, unless there's another funeral to empty the building, I won't ever be able to see you again."

"Which is exactly the position you thought you were in a few days ago. At least this way I was able to express my gratitude. Now, you must go before the ceremony breaks up. No one must see you here. Oh, and before you go, there was a much more important reason for you to come. There is something in the desk drawer for you."

A little while later, Snape was back in the Forbidden Forest waiting for a chance to reenter the Whomping Willow. Tucked into his robes was a locket containing a miniature portrait of Dumbledore.

Within a few days it was clear that something was happening at headquarters, and that whatever it was, was on a strict need-to-know basis. Bella was licking her whiskers like a cat on a constant diet of cream, and on June tenth Snape got the list of potions for Operations and the Infirmary. Suddenly everyone had a task. Suddenly headquarters was humming like a well-oiled machine. Suddenly Snape could no longer get out.

"What do you mean, restricted?" he demanded of the clerk with the ledger.

"Sorry, sir. You're down as residing here. Personnel that reside here can't come and go."

"So the fact that I sleep in a miserable cot on the second floor means I'm less trustworthy?"

"I couldn't say, sir. I just have your name on the list."

Snape stormed away, his anger as much an act for the benefit of the clerk as anything. Internally he was scared. Back in his laboratory, for the first time, he took out the locket with its miniature portrait while inside headquarters. Up until this point he had only used it outside.

Dumbledore appeared within a minute. "Yes, Severus..." he began, then looked around. "So this is where you work. Do you think this is wise?"

"Sir, they're restricting our movements. Those outside are being told to stay home. Those inside aren't being allowed out. He's done this before. Something's happening."

"When did he do this before?"

"Almost a year and a half ago. When Bella and the others escaped from Azkaban."

"Dear Lord," said Dumbledore, "he's making his move. I'll see who I can alert. You put this thing away and lie low. If there's anyone we can't afford to lose right now, it's you."

'Lie low' was an order Snape could cheerfully obey. For the next two days he was the perfect little potions brewer. In the evening of the second day, a messenger came to the laboratory with an order to report to the interview chamber. He went at once.

The chamber was crowded. The first person Snape noticed was Bella, her face radiant with pride, and with joy. The second person he noticed was Rodolphus, hanging on his wife's arm, trying to kiss as much of her in as short a time as he possibly could. Locking down his sudden horror, Snape looked around.

Rookwood, Nott, Mulciber, Jugson, Avery, they were all there. Once again, a mass escape had been engineered from Azkaban. The only good thing was that for once Bella was ignoring Snape entirely. Her attention was all for her husband.

"Well, well," whispered a voice at Snape's ear. "So the Potions professor is still with us. Haven't slipped yet, Severus, or were you saving yourself for me?"

Snape turned to find himself face to face, eye to eye, with Walden Macnair. He feigned a lighthearted attitude. "Welcome back, Macnair. The dungeons haven't been the same without you."

"Have you been keeping them for me? My portrait on the wall and the chains all polished? How devoted. How touching."

"I don't know about polishing chains. I did leave you a gift, though. A Devil's Snare, right next to your desk. Don't move it now before it flowers. Bad luck you know."

Macnair grinned. "Always my best interests at heart. There was a rumor... Did I hear correctly that you burnt your bridges and will be gracing us with your company on a daily basis?"

Snape paused, the not-quite-a-smile frozen on his lips. Now, more than anything, he longed to be able to return to the safety of Hogwarts. "That will depend on the Dark Lord and what he wants me to do. You know that Macnair. Not even you take precedence."

"Such loyalty. Such devotion. To place duty above self like that. I'm going to make a plea to the Dark Lord to allow you some much needed diversion. To allow us both some much needed diversion. You'd like that, wouldn't you?"

\emph{And if I ever find myself alone in a room with you, I'll commit suicide.} Snape thought, but openly to Macnair said, "Don't get your hopes up. He has plans. None of us is getting in the way of his plans."

"Pity," said Macnair. "And I was so looking forward to this."

Much later that evening, Snape again risked taking out the miniature in its locket. When Dumbledore appeared, he said, "It was true. They're all out of Azkaban."

"So far as I know," replied Dumbledore, "it has not hit the news yet. It will be very interesting if it never does. How are you doing?"

"Walden Macnair is after me again."

"You poor boy," said Dumbledore, though Snape suspected he was grinning internally. "We must assist you as best as we can."

There was no mention in \emph{The Daily Prophet} the next day of the Azkaban breakout. There was, however, a tiny notice that Snape's former colleague, the Muggle Studies teacher Professor Burbage, had resigned from Hogwarts. Of more interest was a lengthy memorial piece on Dumbledore written by Elphias Doge.

\emph{I didn't know Dumbledore and Doge were the same age,} Snape thought, and then paused to ponder which of the two he'd assumed was the elder. He couldn't answer the question, but it brought up a new question. \emph{Why is it that so many pureblood witches and wizards either die very young or live to be very old? It does seem to be the half-bloods and muggle-borns who have the more stable life span. The Dark Lord is what? in his seventies? Of course, with the Horcrux business, he hardly counts as an example.}

A messenger stuck his head into the laboratory. "He wants you," was all he said, but Snape was out of the laboratory and heading for the interview chamber in a flash.

This day, the chamber contained a long table, and looked for all the world like a conference room. Snape stopped in the doorway and stared around, uncertain where to go. The others already in the room apparently felt the same reticence. The massive chair at the table's head was clearly for the Dark Lord, but it would be a foolish Death Eater who presumed to guess who would sit at his right hand. Except, of course...

Bella strode into the chamber, her heavy-lidded eyes glittering and her raven hair falling in waves around her shoulders. Behind her came Rodolphus and Rabastan. She went directly to the place of honor and sat there, Rodolphus next to her on her right, and Rabastan to the left of the Dark Lord's seat. Snape raised his eyebrows slightly in surprise. He rather hoped the Dark Lord would take her down a peg for her presumption.

Then the Dark Lord was in their midst. Bella and the Lestrange brothers rose, and all bowed to him as he took his seat at the head of the table. Bella resumed her seat, but as Rodolphus and Rabastan moved to do the same, the Dark Lord stretched out a long, thin hand.

"No," he said quietly, and there was menace in his cold voice. "We think not." He motioned to the others. "Augustus, here beside us. Severus next to Bella. The rest it matters not except... Lucius." Malfoy stepped forward, his face waxy and his eyes frightened. "You," the high voice went on, "will sit next to Augustus, for we may have need of you."

The sharp, soft hiss next to him told Snape that Bella did not like this arrangement at all, but she held her tongue. With a tight smile around his thin lips, the Dark Lord surveyed them all, his crimson gaze resting on each in turn, his lieutenants arrayed around him, free from prison at last.

"We are now poised," said the Dark Lord, "to take command in the wizarding world. One obstacle, the old fool Dumbledore, has been removed from our path thanks to the actions of our good servant Severus."

The Death Eaters glanced at each other. They had, those just out of Azkaban, all heard of this, but so far only as a rumor. It was something else again to have it confirmed by the Dark Lord himself. Snape looked down at his hands, not wanting at this moment to meet anyone's eyes.

"We must now," the Dark Lord continued, "concentrate on the acquisition of power and an unassailable position. We must control the Ministry of Magic. The Minister of Magic must obey us. Augustus?"

Rookwood cleared his throat. "The new Minister is Rufus Scrimgeour. He seems to have taken over a year ago from Cornelius Fudge after we, well... Yes. Scrimgeour comes from Law Enforcement. He was Head Auror before he became Minister and he's... well, he's about as stubborn and bullheaded as they come, and..."

Snape was beginning to feel sorry for Rookwood, having to report on a situation that came into existence only after he went to Azkaban. Rookwood was clearly foundering.

"Will he obey us?" the Dark Lord asked.

"No," said Rookwood. "And he can resist Imperius curses."

"Then he will die," said the Dark Lord. "Who will replace him?"

Rookwood glanced around, sweat beading his forehead. "Usually the Head of Magical Law Enforcement is next in line for the post," he said. "That would be..." he looked down at a small piece of paper that he pulled from his robes, "Pius Thicknesse."

"What of him? Can we control him?"

"It would be easier. He doesn't have Scrimgeour's strength of will."

"You will begin to work on it. Next, the control of information. Rabastan?"

"We're working on infiltrating the \emph{Prophet} and other news sources, Lord," Bella's brother-in-law replied. "Two bits of excellent news. There has been no general statement or release of the information that Severus here was connected to the death of Dumbledore. There's a rumor that the Potter boy is accusing him, but that information is confined to a limited number of people."

"What say you, Severus?" the Dark Lord asked. "Could you return to Hogwarts?"

"Lord," Snape replied. "There were many who saw me that night. Senior members of the staff and members of the Order of the Phoenix saw me go up to the tower and saw me return with young Malfoy. Even if this rumor is not general public knowledge, these people would have to be taken into account before I could go back."

The Dark Lord returned to Rabastan Lestrange. "What is the second piece of good news?"

"The Skeeter woman is doing an exposé on Dumbledore. Soon his name will be discredited again, together with all his unwizardlike ideas."

"Excellent. If it turns out so, she will be rewarded. Lucius."

"Lord," responded Malfoy, and his voice trembled.

"You were once on the Board of Governors of Hogwarts. What now will happen there?"

"Lord, there is no hierarchical ascension to the position of Headmaster. While it is true that Professor McGonagall, as Deputy Headmistress, is now Acting Headmistress, it is not automatic that the permanent position will go to her. The Board will meet this month to discuss the matter and propose candidates, who must be examined and interviewed. The results will be reported back to the Board at its July meeting. They'll then review the candidates and confirm a new Headmaster in August. Meanwhile, Professor McGonagall is in charge."

"What chance is there that we could put one of our own people into this position?"

"Small to none, sir. The candidates must have academic credentials and teaching experience."

All eyes turned to Snape, who shook his head. "Even the Hogwarts Board of Governors would be reluctant to replace a dead headmaster with the man who killed him," he said.

The Dark Lord drew in a deep breath through his slits of nostrils. "Still, it would be to our advantage to have our own servant in the position. So much easier to control the parents when you control the children. And we could eliminate the poisonous courses that have been weakening our world. We shall make this one of our goals. Severus..."

"Yes, Lord."

"What of the headquarters of this Order of the Phoenix now that Dumbledore is dead?" Are its defenses weakened?"

"I don't know, Lord. I haven't tried." It was the first out and out lie that Snape had told the Dark Lord since his return to headquarters, but the Dark Lord did not notice. Instead he turned his head to look at Snape.

"You will try," he said.

"Yes, Lord," Snape replied.

Snape's attempt to get into 12 Grimmauld Place was a spectacular failure. With Dumbledore dead and the charm unraveling, he was able to take a small group of Death Eaters to the little square, but when he walked up to the house and tried an unlocking spell, he was slammed by several curses at once.

Knocked off his feet by a stunner, he was unable to respond to the Confundus, the Tongue-Tying, and the Obliviate curses that followed, all administered by an apparition resembling the long-decaying corpse of Albus Dumbledore. The Death Eaters in the square watched in horror, then rushed forward to pull him away, and apparated with him back to the Dark Lord's headquarters.

"Meant just for him," Snape heard the healer in the Infirmary say as he slowly wakened. "I'd say it was adjusted to respond to his body and no one else's. Powerful little combination. There'll probably be an echo of it left in the house for a long time to come."

Snape opened his eyes. His tongue felt like it was twice its normal size and made of concrete. Sparks were dancing in front of his eyes, and when he tried to remember his own name, a bomb went off in his medulla oblongata that made him feel like the back of his head had just come into forceful contact with a Patton tank. His heart started racing, and he leaned over the side of the bed and began to vomit.

"Now, now," said the healer brusquely. "We can't have that." He began a low chant, and soon Snape was feeling about twenty-five percent human again.

The upside of all this discomfort was that Snape could no longer remember the location of 12 Grimmauld Place. He couldn't find it, he couldn't visualize it, and of course he couldn't take anyone else to it. The Death Eaters who'd been with him could go back to the square, but they couldn't see the house.

Miserable as he felt for several days, Snape had to admit that Moody 'd done a fair job with the protective curses at Grimmauld Place.

At the end of June, they got Yaxley back. By this time Bella's Operations department was targeting lower level operatives and clerks of Law Enforcement, and all they had to do was stamp his release papers. A new guard on the evening shift simply followed orders, and Yaxley was back at headquarters.

Yaxley, with his newfound understanding of the inside workings of Law Enforcement and its personnel, was put in charge of recruitment, with a special emphasis on the Ministry itself.

As July neared the end of its first week, the Dark Lord sent for Snape. They were alone in the interview chamber, where light spread around them in a wide arc. Snape was allowed to stand.

"Tell me again, potions master, the old magic that protects the boy, when does it end?"

"When he comes of age, on his seventeenth birthday."

"The dying day of this month."

"Yes, Lord."

"We shall take him then, he and those muggles he lives with. They will make good sport for us."

"Forgive me, Lord, but it's more likely they'll move him somewhere more protected before then."

"Who will move him, and where? There is more than one who would be the master of the Chosen One." The Dark Lord's sneer was almost a snarl. "If the Ministry pulls one way, and this Order pulls the other, they may well tear the boy in two and spare us the trouble."

"If Potter has his way, it will be the Order, not the Ministry. He has no love for the Ministry, and will flout its authority."

"You know this for a fact?"

"Yes, Lord. It has been so for at least two years, when the Ministry was calling him a liar and wanted to expel him from Hogwarts for defending himself from dementors. It got worse when the Umbridge woman attempted to undermine Dumbledore and has never improved."

"So our control over the Ministry would give us no advantage in dealing with Potter."

"No, Lord."

"Why did you not tell us this before?"

Snape froze, his heart beginning to hammer in his ears. And yet he had not been ordered to his knees or tickled with the promise of pain. Perhaps, this once, it was only a question. "Forgive me, Lord. I thought, in my ignorance, that you wished control of the Ministry for its own sake. And the topic of Potter didn't come up at the last meeting."

"It is unfortunate you no longer gather information from either the Order or from Hogwarts."

"Then I have failed you, Lord?" Snape modulated his voice carefully to reflect the combination of disappointment and fear he wanted the Dark Lord to think he felt. The truth was, he was becoming more and more puzzled by the moment. If the Dark Lord was displeased, why was he - Snape - still standing and free from pain?

"Do you retain any contact that might be a source of intelligence for either of these institutions?"

Snape's mind raced through images of people. \emph{Who can I name that I can protect from harm?} The Dark Lord waited with unusual patience. Finally Snape said, "Yes, Lord. There may be one who could inform me of the doings of the Order. But he's shifty, a coward, and quick to run. The others don't trust him, so he would only be valuable if handled gently at a distance. As long as he himself remains unaware of our interest as we pluck his knowledge, he may be good for much - at least about their outside operations. But bring anyone heavy-handed into it, and we lose him."

The Dark Lord chuckled. "Bella will never learn his name. Who is this unlikely spy?"

"You already know of him. He's the thief named Mundungus Fletcher who was arrested briefly this spring. The Order only uses him for routine work, but he'd probably be a party to plans to move the Potter boy."

"Very good, Severus. We had not believed you had failed us. You will cultivate this Fletcher, and you will inform us, and us alone, until we instruct you to inform others. We shall not remind Bella of the disappearance of her property."

"Yes, Lord." Snape thought again. "Lord, it would be better if I were in London. It is where he chiefly operates. Would you permit me to draw funds and reside outside for a week or two?"

"Yes, Severus. You have our permission."

Snape drew per diem from Operations, to Bella's great indignation, and apparated to London. Once settled in rooms in Chelsea (he was supplementing the Operations money from his own bank account), he shut himself in and took out Dumbledore's portrait.

Dumbledore's appreciation was evident. "Riddle has a more upscale establishment than I imagined," he said, looking around the comfortable bedroom.

"I'm in Chelsea," Snape admitted. "I've done a bad thing."

"And he punished you by sending you to Chelsea? He is slipping."

"No, sir. The two are only marginally connected. I suggested something to him, and he ordered me to proceed, and I just thought I would like to stay in Chelsea, but it's still bad."

"Very well, Severus, if I must be your father confessor, you may tell me what you did."

"I told the Dark Lord I could get information from Mundungus Fletcher."

"Well, that is not necessarily truthful, but I do not know that I would characterize it as bad. Not wise, certainly. Not for you at any rate. Have you planned your escape route?"

Snape twisted his mouth ruefully. "He said it was 'unfortunate' I couldn't gather information anymore. Then he asked if I still had contacts. To say no at that particular moment could have been... unpleasant. I need to get something from Fletcher."

"What is Riddle interested in, specifically?"

"Plans for moving Potter before the end of the month."

"Dear me. Maybe you were right after all. This is rather bad. How soon do you need this information?"

"No deadline. Well, before they make the actual move, naturally. Of course, I could always tell him Fletcher wasn't in on the plans."

"True, and you may have to. Above all, we must keep Harry safe."

Three days later, the situation had changed completely. When Snape looked at his small portrait, Dumbledore was already there. "Severus, what organizations are they targeting for Imperius curses?"

"The Ministry, all levels, the \emph{Prophet}..."

"The Board of Governors for Hogwarts?" Dumbledore was not really asking a question.

"No, I didn't... Wait. Lucius Malfoy did explain to the Dark Lord the procedure for selecting a new headmaster. He seemed interested, and not too concerned about things like credentials."

"Three members of the Board have just proposed Amycus Carrow."

"That's ridiculous!"

"I agree," Dumbledore said, "but if the Board confirms him, even under the Imperius curse, then he will be the current headmaster of Hogwarts. All of us, Nigellus, Dippet, me, would be constrained to assist him in any way we could."

Snape sat back. Outside his window was a quiet, peaceful street, sunlit in the July afternoon. A tenuous and illusive peace. "What are we going to do?" he asked the portrait.

"Severus, why did the Board members not propose your name?"

"I'm not sure, sir. It seemed to be on everyone's mind at the meeting - that I was a possibility, I mean - but I've been away from headquarters for a few days... Maybe because of you... what I did... it wouldn't be tenable."

"Normally I would agree. The situation is bizarre. But we must at all costs ensure that the post does not go to a real Death Eater, or I shall no longer be able to maneuver. Worse, I may have to give information to Riddle. Could you return to your headquarters and lobby for the job?"

Snape shook his head. "How am I supposed to explain how I know about Carrow's nomination? There has to be another way."

Dumbledore disappeared for a moment. When he returned, he looked irritated. "You need to come to Hogwarts again, Severus. I shall see if I can get Alastor as well, but we need to keep it small and close. Minerva is having violent hysterics right now, but by this evening she will probably have calmed down. Let no one else see you."

Snape closed the locket on the now empty portrait. He felt sick. Amycus Carrow in charge of Hogwarts? In charge of what was left of Dumbledore? Disaster piled on disaster, and if the Dark Lord called now, Snape had nothing to give him. He had not yet spoken to Mundungus Fletcher.

Snape reached Hogwarts shortly before nine o'clock that evening and once again made his way through the tunnel to the Whomping Willow. This time he had only to worry about Hagrid since neither students nor staff were in the school in July. The sun had still an hour to go before setting, so Snape was wary as he circled through the forest around Hagrid's hut, hoping the gamekeeper wouldn't accidentally look toward the hill while he was climbing it. He made it through safely, and even managed to avoid ghosts and poltergeist on the way up to the gargoyle staircase on the seventh floor.

The passage to the Acting Headmistress's office was open and waiting for him.

The only people in the office were Professor McGonagall and Alastor Moody, who had clearly been talking and now lapsed into silence as he entered. McGonagall stood, turned her back on him without a word, and walked across the circular room to look down from the window onto the lake below. Moody leaned forward, hands on knees and a scowl on his face, but said nothing. Dumbledore slumbered in his portrait.

Snape paused on the threshold, uncertain how to proceed. Seconds ticked into minutes, but neither of the other two invited him to enter or sit down. Neither spoke a word. When the wait became painful, Snape said, "Excuse me, I seem to have mistaken the appointment. I'll not trouble you further," and himself turned to go back down the stairs.

Dumbledore stirred. "Come back, Severus, please. None of us must act too hastily now. There is far too much at stake."

Snape paused. "Did you explain the situation, or are we going into this cold?" he asked.

The portrait Dumbledore sighed, "I have told Minerva the events of the night on the tower. I understand that you have shown Alastor what transpired there. There is a certain reluctance..."

"Reluctance!" McGonagall exploded, wheeling to face into the room. "I'd like a bit more reluctance when he aims killing curses at old and trusted friends! How hard was it for ye, Snape? From the ease ye got that curse off, I'll be wagering ye 'd had some practice. Could ye do for me as smoothly?"

Moody was already on his feet, and Dumbledore had risen in his portrait with a crisp "Minerva!" Snape stood rigid in the doorway, every vestige of color drained from his face, black eyes locked and sealed. He was trembling.

"Minerva, I have explained that I requested..."

McGonagall didn't allow Dumbledore to finish. "And he should ha' refused! He should ha' fought back! D' ye no understand, Albus? Ye dinna know what would ha' happened! Maybe ye ha' the right o' it and ye would ha' died anyway, but maybe he'd ha' taken them by surprise and ye 'd still be with us. Ye dinna know! But he took tha' chance away, now didn't he, and now none o' us will ever know, and ye'll ne'er come back! But tha's the way of it when killin's been the answer before, so simple to let it be the answer again! I'll no work with a murderer!" She spun again to the view of the lake, her back stiff with anger and grief.

Snape's pallor began to crimson now, points of color appearing in his cheeks as rage rose in him, rage against McGonagall, rage against Dumbledore, rage against fate.

"How dare you," he hissed. "How dare you look down on me from the safety of your fortified tower and the luxury of six weeks of hindsight and tell me what I should have done with two seconds to decide and an order to obey. In case you hadn't noticed, we're still fighting a war. Maybe I should have died on the tower with Dumbledore, but then I'd miss the pleasure of watching you take orders from Amycus Carrow..."

"Severus!" Dumbledore thundered. "Both of you! Silence!" In the deceptive calm that followed, his voice became gentler. "Alastor, please sit down. Severus, come into the room as well, and sit, it does not matter where. Minerva, I beg of you... This was not Severus's decision to make. He was in a difficult position, but the decision was mine. Because of his sacrifice, Hogwarts is still safe, Harry is still alive..."

"Sacrifice!" McGonagall advanced into the center of the room, an avenging fury. "What sacrifice did he make but to cushion his nest with... with... Voldemort!" And her face glowed with cruel satisfaction when Snape winced and clutched his arm.

"Professor McGonagall." Moody finally spoke. "I think you should know that Professor Snape's reception by Voldemort was not pleasant. He was punished..."

"Good!" McGonagall spat out. "There is some justice in the world, then."

Dumbledore started to speak again, but Moody raised a hand to silence him. He walked over to where Snape still stood defensively in the doorway. "Severus," he said, gruff but with an underlying gentleness, "there is no one among us who has a job as difficult as yours. We all live in danger, but at least our paths are wide, straight, and well lit. If any one of us dies, we die knowing that our sacrifice was recognized by others. Your paths are narrow and twisted, dark and hidden, and if you go, all the people you died to save 'll vilify your name. I couldn't do that, boyo. I don't have the courage to do what you do."

Moody faced McGonagall across the room. "I won't tell you to give up your anger. You've got to deal with it on your own. But as I understand it, this lad's going back into the lion's den tonight, and there're some things we need to discuss. You owe him at least the courtesy of sitting in the same room and hearing what we have to say."

"Now," continued Moody after McGonagall and Snape were both seated. "What's this about Amycus Carrow?"

Dumbledore explained what he believed to be the result of combined Imperius and Confundus spells while McGonagall listened aghast. "How could they ever get away with proposing a known Death Eater," she exclaimed at last, "even if some of the members of the Board are Imperiused and Confunded?"

"He isn't a known Death Eater," Snape said quietly. "Not him, and not his sister Alecto. When the Dark Lord fell the first time, they escaped the roundup, and no one ever implicated them. Not only were they never found guilty, they were never tried. In fact, they were never accused. Never been to Azkaban, never been in a Ministry holding pen... They have a cleaner record than I do."

"Oh," said McGonagall sharply. "I see. Then the Ministry must be warned that they and the Board are targets for Imperius curses. They must take steps."

"They know, Minerva," said Moody. "But these spells can be very subtle. You don't know who to trust. I'd bet my life they'll never put an Imperius on old Rufus, but I wouldn't trust anyone around him. Rufus is our best bet. He's strong, independent, hates Death Eaters... As long as he controls the Ministry, I think you're safe from the Board and Mr. Carrow. Wish he could get along with Harry, though."

"We need contingency plans," said Dumbledore. "If we reach the point where we no longer trust the Ministry, we have to be sure Riddle - that's Severus's Dark Lord, Minerva. We do try to avoid distressing Severus unnecessarily - doesn't get control of this office. If he can put someone like Carrow in here, Hogwarts is doomed. Every student and every staff member will be in danger. In that contingency, we would need someone Riddle thinks he controls, but who is really ours."

"So," said McGonagall acidly, glaring at Snape, "that's where you come in."

"Yes, Minerva, that is where Severus comes in. While the Ministry is safe, we wait for the Board to make its choice. If the Ministry falls, we must be sure the choice is Severus rather than Amycus. It is a delicate operation, and I fear there is a possibility that some of us may get hurt."

"Us?" Moody raised his eyebrows.

"It was a collective pronoun, Alastor. I still feel part of things you know. The one person we must keep safe at all costs, at the cost of every single other person if necessary, is Harry Potter. Severus, what will assure your status?"

"Information," Snape replied immediately.

"And what information does Riddle want above all else?"

"Information about when Potter is leaving his uncle's house."

"Then we must be prepared to provide him with that information if it becomes necessary."

"Hold on!" Moody was on his feet now. "How does that save Harry?"

"We will arrange to protect Harry," Dumbledore assured him, "but we must also protect Hogwarts. We must be prepared, as a last resort, to give Riddle the information he wants."

"And if that isn't enough?" Snape asked. "Or if your plan goes awry?"

"We must take that risk. Not to take it if we have to is to surrender everything. Alastor, what are the plans for moving Harry from the Dursley house?"

Dumbledore's request was greeted with stunned silence from all three. Then Snape rose and faced the portrait behind McGonagall's desk. "I don't want this information," he said. "I don't want the Dark Lord to have it."

"Severus," said Dumbledore, and it was a measure of his fear that he forgot Snape's mark, "if it becomes necessary, you will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry's departure from his aunt and uncle's. Not to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so well informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to ensure Harry's safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus, if you are forced to take part in the chase, be sure to act your part convincingly... I am counting on you to remain in Lord Voldemort's good books as long as possible, or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows. Now, Alastor, what is the plan."

"Why Fletcher?" Moody asked. "Why don't I suggest decoys?"

"Because Severus has already told Riddle he can get information from Fletcher. If anyone is questioned about this in the future, it will be clear that Fletcher was, indeed, the source of his information."

Moody grunted. "The twenty-sixth," he said. "We're moving him Saturday the twenty-sixth at nightfall. We're getting the Dursleys out earlier in the day."

"There you are," Dumbledore told Snape. "Prepare your Mundungus cover, but don't say anything to Riddle unless we are unable to avoid it."&#13;
