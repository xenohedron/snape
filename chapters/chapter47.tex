\subsection{Chapter 47: Chapter 47 – Into the Fire}

\textbf{If You Are Ready: Into the Fire}

Snape hurried down to his dungeon office to change from Hogwarts robes into black Victorian trousers and frock coat, exactly what he had worn during his duel with Lockhart. Then, leaving the school, he was startled by the glittering stars. The last time he'd noticed the sky had been a month ago, on a moonless night at the end of May. Now it was a moonless night at the end of June, and Snape took one last moment of peace before the storm.

Walking to the edge of the cliff, he looked down at the lake, as studded with stars as the sky it reflected. He remembered then the two children, huddled over the dials and tripod of a telescope, red hair and black hair mingled together like the red and black of his patronus fox.

\emph{Where I am going, Lily, I dare not even think of you. So I will think of you now. Just for a moment. For the night will be a long one, and it is beyond my power to see if there will be a dawn. But whether this night is the end, or a new beginning, it is yours. I do this for you.}

Then he turned, and with resolute steps walked down the hill to the Hogsmeade gate. It was open for him. Snape stepped through, closed down the last of the doors, focused on the summons, and disapparated.

Snape apparated into a dark and overgrown graveyard, one clearly intended for the private use of a single family and their dependents. He was facing a yew tree, and could make out the spectral silhouette of a small church just beyond. He could see nothing else, and dared not conjure a light.

Turning slowly, Snape realized he was standing not far from a small hill whose darker bulk blocked the stars. On the hillside near the summit rose a house. Snape could see the faintest of glimmers through the drawn drapes. \emph{If the Dark Lord is still anywhere near, it will be in that house.}

Inching his way forward in the darkness, moving slowly and carefully lest he catch his foot on a hummock and fall, Snape approached the hill, then began to climb it. \emph{Pity I can't see. There ought to be a drive leading up to the house. Maybe better I can't; gravel can be so noisy.}

There were two main scenarios at this moment, assuming the Dark Lord was in the house. The first was that he be allowed to enter, then apprehended and brought before the Dark Lord. The second was that the Death Eaters be sent to intercept him outside the house, then bring him to the Dark Lord. Snape had no illusions about being able to sneak in.

The answer came in a series of explosive pops on either side of him well before he'd gotten to the mansion. Snape stopped immediately and raised his hands, palms outward, to shoulder height. He stood unmoving as a circle of Death Eaters, robed in white and masked in hoods, apparated in a circle around him. \emph{Now it begins.}

They crowded him, pushing ungently, and one reached into Snape's inner coat pocket to extract his wand. Snape didn't fight back, nor did he struggle when another stepped behind him and grasped his arms, twisting them down and behind him, where his wrists were bound with magical cords.

A new Death Eater stepped in and wrapped cords around his elbows, wrenching them together. Snape gasped at the pressure this put on his shoulder sockets, but he didn't have to endure this pain long, for a voice, a voice Snape recognized as Lucius Malfoy's spoke up.

"Leave it. You go beyond your commission."

A familiar but unrecognized voice replied, "Who cares? He's dead meat anyway. Why not have a little fun?"

"Never presume that you know what the Dark Lord wants. This one's not condemned yet."

"As good as... The Dark Lord won't object to our having some fun."

"Not if we punish where the Dark Lord intends to preserve. You have a lot to learn."

In the end they bound his wrists only, and dragged Snape, stumbling, the rest of the way up the hill.

He was forced into the house and up a staircase, then down a hall to a sitting room.

There the Dark Lord sat, in appearance almost as he had been when he'd vanished the first time. "Look who has joined us. Dumbledore's little lapdog. You would not come when we called, but you will come at your own will. Why do you do this - to show how you are superior, in control? We will show that you are not."

Snape was pushed into the center of a circle that focused on the Dark Lord, and forced to his knees. He was thinking very fast. "No, Lord. I come now because I could not come before, but I come always at your bidding, never at my own or another's"

"We shall see," whispered the Dark Lord, "We shall see how well you obey us."

And the world exploded into pain.

When reason returned, Snape was lying on the floor on his side, and knew he'd been twisting and kicking with the pain. Screaming perhaps, too, but that he couldn't tell for sure. His shoulders ached abominably. A pair of Death Eaters entered the circle and pulled him back onto his knees facing the Dark Lord. The great red eyes didn't try to engage his own, and Snape rested for a moment, his breath coming in short, sharp gasps.

The Dark Lord was speaking. "Our servant at Hogwarts has told us of you, of the long years of your servitude to Dumbledore, starting even before our departure, of your ambition and your treason. But most of all he has told us of your duplicity and cunning. Hear my Death Eaters! how this false traitor plots to deceive us. While the rest of you were lying low under the nearest rock you could find, this apostate, this defector, was studying how to dupe and mislead us. He intends to control us by controlling the information we receive, and he who was once open and trusting as a child with his father is now a false dissembler. For he has been practicing and perfecting the lying art of Occlumency."

A murmur ran through the circle of Death Eaters, and Snape felt cold grip his heart. Barty Crouch had made the occlumency itself the threat to the Dark Lord, and now Snape had to think fast. He couldn't deny that he was an occlumens - so bald-faced a lie would only earn the Dark Lord's wrath - but perhaps he could minimize its effectiveness or claim it was involuntary. \emph{Don't talk. Don't say anything. Be patient. Wait for permission to speak.}

The Dark Lord leaned nearer. "Is it true that you hide your thoughts from Dumbledore?"

"Yes," Snape whispered, and waited.

"Is it true that you hid your thoughts from our servant?"

"Yes." Pain was gathering in a knot around Snape's stomach.

"If you had known he was our servant, would you have hidden your thoughts from him?"

"I don't know." The pain receded.

"Why do you not know?"

"I can't control it. It just happens."

"When did this start?"

"When I took up my assignment at Hogwarts. There were things I feared Dumbledore would see. But when he read me, they were covered up. He didn't know they were there. I don't know how I did it."

"And when he is not reading you, do you uncover them?"

Snape saw the trap. "I can't uncover them. I don't know how."

"If you have something you do not want us to see, do you cover it?"

Snape paused as if to search his mind. The pain in his shoulders was becoming excruciating, and he had no feeling in his hands. "The only things that are covered, are covered against Dumbledore."

"Show them to me."

Another trap. "I can't. I don't know how."

"We ourself shall find them. Macnair."

The Death Eater stepped behind the kneeling Snape and took his head, forcing it back so that he couldn't avoid the Dark Lord's eyes. The red eyes that now bored into his brain. The probe was like a claw, ripping through the tapestry of Snape's thoughts, and he tried to close his own eyes. The Dark Lord leaned forward and gripped Snape's face, and with his thumbs pried the lids open.

"Clean, clean, open and innocent. Are we weak like Dumbledore that we cannot see these covered places?" Then there was a pause and a gleam of triumph. "Ah, here is one, so cleverly hidden even we might have missed it. Open it. Uncover it for us."

The trap yawned wide. "I can't. I don't know how."

With a curse like a howl, the Dark Lord threw Snape from him, rose in menace and, wand pointed at his helpless prisoner, cried, "Crucio!"

The sea of pain washed over and through Snape, and he knew he was screaming and crying at the same time. The Dark Lord's voice penetrated the pain and said, "Uncover the thoughts and show them to us!"

"I don't know how!" Snape sobbed.

The pain stopped. The Dark Lord was seated again, calm again. "Then what you cannot give, we will take."

This time three Death Eaters stepped forward, one on either side of Snape to grasp his arms and hold him upright and steady, with Macnair again behind. \emph{This can't be too easy. If it's too easy, he'll suspect.} The blood-red gaze pierced Snape's mind and once more clawed its way down to the hidden, covered thoughts.

The Dark Lord spoke, and his words were soft, like a caress, "From a prisoner we rend what we want, but a servant should obey. Do you agree that we do this? Do you endure willingly what we must do?"

"I do," Snape replied. He felt the tendrils of the Dark Lords mind pry and probe at the locked door, testing it, analyzing it.

"It should not take much, not if properly applied. Macnair - start at the bottom of the backbone and move up quickly. On my word. Now!"

An agonizing spasm gripped the small of Snape's back and shot like a bolt of fire up his spine, to hurl itself against the base of his skull and burst inside his brain. At the same time, the Dark Lord's tendrils wrenched at the closed door so that with force before and pressure behind, it shattered, strewing forth a torrent of images: Granger with her enormous teeth, Longbottom cringing over a cauldron, Potter and Weasley screaming curses, and after them the images of fifteen years of students he'd shouted at and insulted, Fred and George Weasley prominent among them.

As the Dark Lord sifted through these thoughts, Snape's body jerked and twisted against the pain of Macnair's attack and the violation of his mind, but the two Death Eaters held him steady. After a while his struggles quieted.

The Dark Lord was almost chuckling. "We see why you did not wish Dumbledore to see this. Who is the boy with the cauldron?"

"Longbottom," Snape gasped.

"The auror's boy. Good. Let us see what else we can find."

Snape whimpered, but allowed the penetration of his brain without resistance. Another locked door was found, and another bolt of fire slammed into Snape's skull. Images of discord and dissension, of Dumbledore's angry face, of Igor Karkaroff and his mark poured forth through the breach.

The Dark Lord found a third door, and by this time Snape felt as if he would faint from the pain, yet still he managed to hold on, and release the thoughts at precisely the right moment. At the fourth door, he appeared to collapse, "Lord, no, please... I can't do this anymore. Please, help me..." but the Dark Lord was implacable, and pain shattered the last of his defenses, and he fainted.

It seemed hours later that Snape woke, but from the positions where the others were standing, it was more likely only a few minutes. He was still lying in the circle, but the bonds that tied his hands had been removed. Snape managed to pull himself to his hands and knees.

"Bring him to us," the Dark Lord ordered, and the two Death Eaters caught him by the arms and dragged him to face the Dark Lord again.

The search of Snape's brain was more thorough this time, an intrusion into every corner and crevice, a penetration of his very soul. When it was over, Snape was drained and exhausted, but the Dark Lord seemed pleased.

"Greet your newly-returned brother," he said to the others, "for he has proven himself our loyal servant, and kept nothing hidden but what would aid our enemies or demonstrate his loyalty to us. Comfort him and give him drink, and in a few minutes we will question him as to his service these last years of our exile."

The other Death Eaters surrounded Snape and brought him water. Most of them had removed their masks, and he recognized Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, Nott, Avery, Macnair, and someone who could only be an adult Peter Pettigrew. He didn't talk to them, though. He felt as if he'd been beaten over his whole body, his shoulders and back throbbed with mind-numbing pain, and his head ached and spun dizzily.

The respite lasted barely ten minutes, when Snape again knelt before the Dark Lord. This time he was not bound, and there was no mind probe, but the residual pain from his previous torment had not abated, and he struggled to concentrate on his answers.

"All our Death Eaters have been put through interrogation - you should not see this as singling you out. You have not hidden as they have, and so you have more to answer for. You will respond openly and guilelessly. There is still punishment for those who hide from us what we require."

Snape nodded in understanding.

"Why did you not answer the summons?"

"I was in the stands at the Triwizard Tournament, one of the administrators. To have left at once would have cast suspicion on me and jeopardized my ability to serve you at Hogwarts."

"Why would you think we wanted you to stay at Hogwarts?"

"It was the last place you assigned me. I had no other orders. If you wished me elsewhere you would send me, and that would be easy to accomplish, but if you wished me to stay at Hogwarts it was best I not endanger the position. I chose the course that would cause the least damage."

"Does Dumbledore suspect you have come to us?"

"Dumbledore sent me."

The response brought a twisting, cramping pain in Snape's stomach and abdomen, and he doubled up in agony. The Dark Lord spoke in a menacing tone, "So you come at Dumbledore's pleasure, not ours?"

"He chose the time of my coming, not the coming itself. Dumbledore thinks I spy for him. The Potter boy had come back, Diggory was dead, Karkaroff had run. It was already known you'd returned. He sent me, and I took advantage of his order. Now he still doesn't suspect me, but I am able to answer your call."

"How long have you known we would return?"

"Known? Since three years ago, when you controlled the body of Quirinus Quirrell, but I have suspected it and hoped for it for fourteen years."

"Really? Why?"

"When the Lestranges and Barty Crouch attacked the Longbottoms, it was in search of information regarding your whereabouts. It occurred to me at the time that they wouldn't have done this if they didn't have some solid reason for believing that a part of you at least was still alive. It was a small thing to go on, but it was all I had."

"What has happened to our servant?"

Snape sighed. "He blundered and was captured by Dumbledore. He was given Veritaserum and confessed everything. But when Cornelius Fudge was called into the room, the Minister chose to summon a dementor as a guard. Without warning, the dementor sprang on your servant and administered the kiss. He is lost to us."

"Useful things, dementors. Tell us, did you at any time shut down completely against our servant and prevent him from reading any part of your mind?"

Snape looked up at the Dark Lord with wide, open, trusting eyes. "No, Lord. I can't do that I don't know how."

"Why then would he say you did?"

"I don't know."

"Do you think he was disloyal? Letting his hatred of you interfere with his duty to us?"

"I'm sure he was as loyal to you as he was able to be."

"Well spoken. Now you will tell us of Hogwarts and of Dumbledore."

For the next two hours, the Dark Lord questioned Snape about every aspect of life at Hogwarts and about everything there was to know of Dumbledore. For the most part, Snape simply told the truth. It was information known to every child of every Death Eater in any case. From time to time he claimed ignorance, which was more often true than not. Only a couple of times did he find himself concocting an out-and-out lie. The spies' adage was true. Whenever possible, stick as close to the truth as possible. That way, you are less likely to be tripped up.

Then, finally, grueling as the experience was, it was over.

"You have done well, faithful servant. Return now to your post, keep your eyes and ears open, and await our instructions."

The Dark Lord was gone, and Snape was free to return to Hogwarts.

The other Death Eaters surrounded Snape, congratulating him on successfully passing through the Dark Lord's ordeal. It was then, listening to their voices, that Snape realized the one who'd wanted to have a little more 'fun' was Peter Pettigrew. He filed that information, but said nothing.

Lucius Malfoy returned Snape's wand. "I'm glad you made it. It was sticky there for a while. He really wanted you dead."

"I think it was Barty Crouch who wanted me dead. He hated you, too, you know."

"Whatever for?"

"You never suffered. You got away free. He wanted to punish all of us."

"How many others in Azkaban feel the same? It makes you stop and think."

"It does indeed. Good night, Lucius. "

"You take care."

Snape started down the hill, but as he walked through the overgrown grass he began to feel the full effects of the night. The adrenaline that had helped carry him through was now draining out of his body, and he was exhausted. His shoulders ached wretchedly. His back seemed to be on fire, and it made walking difficult. In fact, he was beginning to stumble and stagger. And above all, there was the pain in his head, so fierce that he saw little flashes of light in the predawn, and it made him nauseous.

A little way from the house, Snape drew out his wand, concentrated, and apparated to Hogsmeade.

The physical strain of apparating was almost too much. There, under the trees on the outskirts of the village, Snape's legs buckled under him, and he dropped to the ground and began to retch uncontrollably, though since he hadn't eaten anything for hours, it had little effect except to bring up bile and give him stomach cramps.

When the spasms abated, he picked up the wand that had fallen beside him and pointed it at Hogwarts castle. Immediately, a misty form spurted from the end of the wand and shot upwards towards Dumbledore's tower. Then Snape staggered to his feet and began to walk through Hogsmeade.

It was like wading through thick, viscous mud. Every step was an effort. He found he had to lean against the houses to stay upright. The sky was lightening toward dawn, but the Hogwarts gate still seemed an infinite distance away. Then...

"Severus?" It was Dumbledore's quiet voice, carrying easily through the silence of the sleeping town. "Severus, are you there?"

"Here, Headmaster," Snape answered, and suddenly Dumbledore and Hagrid were with him, supporting him, helping him stand.

"Shh... shh... It is all right. You are home. We are here to care for you."

Hagrid took off his coat and wrapped it around Snape. The warmth was soothing, and Snape was grateful for it. Then Hagrid bent down and lifted Snape in his arms, as if he were carrying a child. "I'll get him up to the hospital, Professor," he said.

"No, no. The fewer people who see him, the better. Take him up to my office. I shall fetch Madam Pomfrey. Go quickly, and try to make him comfortable. The password is 'licorice'. Hagrid lumbered quickly up the hill, Dumbledore right behind him, then up to the headmaster's tower. Snape was vaguely aware of going up the stairs, and of meeting no one. In just a few minutes, they were in Dumbledore's office.

Hagrid laid Snape, still wrapped in the coat, on a large sofa next to the fireplace and lit the fire. He found some pillows and slipped them under Snape's head. The movement caused Snape to moan slightly, but the warmth was comforting, and when Hagrid held a glass of mead to his mouth, Snape accepted it gratefully.

Dumbledore was there a few minutes later with Madam Pomfrey.

"Well," she said matter-of-factly. "It looks like you've had quite a night. Here, drink this first. It should help clear your head." The bitter, burning liquid did, in fact, help. Snape opened his eyes and was alert again. "Now, tell me where it hurts."

"Mostly my head and my back."

"What did they do?"

"Mind probe, and some nonverbal spell that sent fire from the base of my spine up into my skull."

"That sounds like Ignispina, but it shouldn't have such a powerful effect. How many times?"

"Four."

"Heavens! Hagrid, get his coat and shirt off. I need to examine the damage."

Snape balked at removing his shirt for Pomfrey, but she just laughed. "That thing on your arm, child! And the marks on your back! I've known about them for nearly fourteen years. Who do you think took care of you while you were sedated, that time you tried to walk off the top of the Astronomy tower? You have very few secrets that are hidden from me, Master Snape."

There was no point whatsoever in arguing against that, and Snape was soon lying on his side while Pomfrey examined him. She was far more interested in the point where the spinal column entered the skull than the rest of his back.

"That's where there could be serious damage, especially after four hits. You-Know-Who certainly fails as a personnel manager, treating valuable staff like this. I'm going to fit you with a neck brace, Severus, to help relieve some of the pressure there. The damage done by the Legilimency probe is something Albus will have to handle. The injury to the shoulders is purely physical. I have a draught that will reattach the cartilage and reduce the inflammation. And I think the best thing for the rest of the backbone is a little old-fashioned chanting."

Taking out the wand she seldom used, Pomfrey began to rotate it along Snape's spine, crooning a low song all the while, very much like Snape's grandmother had done in her healing practice. It was a form of treatment that Snape knew well and could do himself. After several minutes his back felt remarkably better.

They made him stay lying down while Pomfrey went for the draught and the brace, but after she returned and fitted the stiff white collar around his neck, Snape was able to sit up again. He was still in pain, but it was a much reduced and more manageable pain.

Dumbledore send to the kitchens for breakfast, which he, Snape, and Hagrid shared there in the headmaster's office.

"Now," Dumbledore said when they were finished, "let us see what happened. If you do not object, of course."

"I'm not really looking forward to this. Legilimency has become one of my least favorite experiences."

"If you feel strongly about it, I will not do it."

"It's all right. Go ahead."

Dumbledore sat opposite Snape, where he rested on the sofa, and they locked gazes. After the torment of the night before, Dumbledore's probe was gentle and diffident. From the look on Dumbledore's face when he was finished, it had been a far more disturbing experience for him than for Snape.

"I did not realize I was asking you to do so much."

"You see now why it was necessary to use the Cruciatus curse. I had to be ready."

"Yes, you were right about that. Where is the house?"

"Yorkshire. Outside a village called Little Hangleton. I could pinpoint it for you easily, though I doubt he will ever go back there."

"I agree. He probably will not. What are you to do now?"

"Wait. He'll summon me again to give me specifics. Probably spy on you. He may want me to go back to my old job."

"Ah, yes. Teaching defensive tactics." Dumbledore meditated for a moment. "Tell me about Pettigrew."

Snape hesitated. "He was there. He's alive. There's something wrong with his right hand, but he's alive." Then he said what Dumbledore wanted him to say. "Black didn't kill him. He went to Azkaban for something he didn't do." After a pause, he added, "He did other things he should have gone to Azkaban for, but that wasn't one of them."

Dumbledore sighed. "Can you not leave the past behind?"

Snape shook his head. "Tell me this. Who gave Lily to the Dark Lord?"

"Peter Pettigrew, if I understand correctly."

"And why was Pettigrew the Secret-Keeper?"

Dumbledore didn't answer the question.

"There. It has to do with Black. Until I know what happened back then, until I know why she died, I can't trust him. For all I know, he told Potter to make Pettigrew the Secret-Keeper. If that's true, he caused her death. Can you assure me that's not true?"

There were only a couple of days left before the students returned to King's Cross Station. During that time, they continued to attend classes, even though they'd finished their exams. The two classes that were not held were Defense against the Dark Arts, since the real Alastor Moody had not been the teacher for the year and was in any case receiving medical treatment, and Potions - the whereabouts of the Potions Master was unexplained.

Snape was in Dumbledore's tower with the neck brace, that being the principal reason why Dumbledore didn't want the students to see him. Madam Pomfrey visited him several times each day and, on the afternoon of the Leaving Feast, told him that the brace could safely be removed to allow him to attend.

The Great Hall was somber that evening as Snape entered ahead of most of the students. It was draped in black, in memory of Cedric Diggory. Snape's place this evening was next to McGonagall, and as he made his way to the dais, he heard someone behind him gruffly clear his throat.

"You're looking reasonably well under the circumstances."

Snape turned to face Moody, and all his barriers went up immediately. Several months of trusting neither the face nor the eye could not be overcome in a moment.

Moody just laughed. "That's a formidable defense system you have there, boyo. I'd hate to have the job of interrogating you."

"Does that mean you're renting out my room to someone else?"

"I hear you took a different vacation package that makes Azkaban look like a kiddie amusement park."

"It had its moments."

Moody raised a hand and patted Snape on the shoulder. "You take care of yourself out there, laddie," he said, and went to take his own place at the high table.

Snape eased into the seat next to McGonagall. To his great surprise, she laid her hand on his for a moment with a positively maternal look in her eyes. "I'm glad you're all right," she whispered, and beyond her Snape saw Flitwick give him a 'thumbs up' sign. Everyone else seemed perfectly normal.

The students filed in, subdued by the gravity of the occasion. Snape found himself watching Potter, wondering about the connection between the boy and the Dark Lord, then realized Potter was watching him. He turned away, but was aware that the boy continued to observe him for some time.

At the end of an unusually quiet feast, Dumbledore rose to speak. "The end of another year. There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight, but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person, who should be sitting here enjoying our feast with us. I would like you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric Diggory."

They did, staff and students raising their goblets and saying together, "Cedric Diggory."

"Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort," continued Dumbledore as murmurs of panic swept through the Hall. "The Ministry of Magic does not wish me to tell you this..."

As Dumbledore went on, Snape looked around the hall. Grief and horror at the Hufflepuff table, shock at Ravenclaw, anger and defiance at Gryffindor. And Slytherin... what about Slytherin? Malfoy was whispering to Crabbe and Goyle. \emph{Do you know your fathers helped the Dark Lord torture me?} There were others - sons, daughters, nieces, and nephews of Death Eaters. They would not support Dumbledore. And when Dumbledore proposed a toast to Harry Potter, many of the Slytherin students stayed in their seats.

Snape did not remain seated. With the rest of the Hall, he rose to drink to Potter. Malfoy looked surprised and disgusted, but Snape wasn't worried. The Dark Lord would not be angry.

Dumbledore spoke for a brief while longer. "...Lord Voldemort's gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust... we are all facing dark and difficult times... if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened... Remember Cedric Diggory."

The next morning the students left on the train for King's Cross Station. The teachers would stay at Hogwarts a few days longer, clearing the classrooms, ordering supplies, locking everything down.

Dumbledore visited Snape in the dungeon classroom. "Anything yet?"

"No, he hasn't called. He may be waiting until I'm home again, to avoid suspicion."

"As for that, I too shall be sending for you at your home. I suggest you have reasons prepared why you would have to make a few trips to London, just in case you are asked."

"London? What's in London?"

"There are a few people I want you to meet."

Three days later, Snape was home in Spinner's End. While he busied himself cleaning and straightening the house, and catching up on some reading, he waited for the summons from the Dark Lord and from Dumbledore.

He didn't have long to wait.

The summons was in the form of a misty silver phoenix that seeped in through the edge of the window and hovered near Snape, who was reading a murder mystery about change ringing and death in a church bell tower. Dumbledore's voice entered Snape's head.

'Could you make a trip down to London this morning? Meet me at King's Cross Station by the clock tower. Say, eleven o'clock? No need to reply if you are coming.'

\emph{Wonderful. I'm supposed to apparate into a busy central London train station in the middle of the day, but not let anyone see me do it. Where does he come up with these things?}

Assuming that Dumbledore would look like the typical pureblood wizard trying to blend into a muggle world, Snape thought carefully about what he would wear. With the long hair, it should be casual - only George Harrison could get away with long hair and a three-piece suit with a bowler hat. He ended up with dark trousers, a blue shirt, and a denim jacket. At ten thirty, he apparated into the men's restroom next to the social hall of St. Pancras church, reasoning that on a Wednesday morning it was unlikely to be occupied.

He was wrong, of course, since St. Pancras ministered to the homeless of the area. Luckily the only person who saw Snape arrive was himself recovering from the effects of a half gallon of wine the night before and chose to regard Snape as part of the total experience. Murmuring 'Excuse me,' Snape slipped out of the restroom, out of the church, and onto Euston Road. From there it was a short walk to the underground, which he used to cross beneath Euston Road and approach King's Cross Station. All in all, it reminded him of his childhood.

Dumbledore looked fairly normal, except that he was wearing a poncho. Together the two walked in a roughly northerly direction for about twenty minutes until they reached a small square surrounded by dilapidated houses, some with broken windows and all with peeling paint.

"Now," said Dumbledore, "the decision is yours. Our destination is protected by a Fidelius charm, and I am the Secret Keeper. If you do not wish to be part of this, if it might endanger your position with Riddle, we go no further. If you wish to continue with me, you need to read this note. You have total control of the outcome."

Snape took the folded piece of paper that Dumbledore held out to him. He considered for a few minutes how he would explain to the Dark Lord that there was something he couldn't reveal. Satisfied that it was feasible, he opened the note and read:

\emph{The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London.}

Dumbledore immediately took the piece of paper and burned it. In front of them the row of houses was changing, and one that Snape hadn't noticed before suddenly appeared. It looked just as run-down as the others, with chipped paint and dirty, gaping, empty windows. It was to the battered door of this house that Dumbledore led Snape.

The door of the house opened, and Snape found himself staring into the eyes of Remus Lupin. "Good," Lupin said, "you're here." He stood aside to let them pass into an entry hall lined with portraits. It smelled of mildew and rot. Almost at once a voice began screaming, "Blood traitors and squibs! Mongrels and mudbloods! How dare you bring this trash into my house!" Dumbledore quickly seized Snape's arm and pushed him into a parlor to the right.

"We do not really need to listen to her right now," said Dumbledore apologetically.

Inside the parlor a group of people was gathered. They turned to stare as he and Dumbledore walked in, followed by Lupin. Snape had the feeling that this was not exactly the most friendly group he'd ever met.

"Well," said Dumbledore calmly. "Here he is. Severus, you already know Lupin, Black, Moody, and Hagrid, of course. This is Dedalus Diggle, Emmeline Vance, Sturgis Podmore, and Elphias Doge. My brother Aberforth was supposed to be here, too, but you can never get him to show up on time for anything. This is what remains of the original Order of the Phoenix. Lady and gentlemen, this is Severus Snape."

The welcome was less than warm. It seemed obvious that all present were aware of Snape's past as a Death Eater, but were less than convinced of his conversion to the anti-Voldemort side. Black was openly sneering. "What do we need him for? He's not going to help us."

Dumbledore didn't hide his impatience. "Severus has already done more for our cause this year than any other person in this room. If you cannot accept that, then we are doomed before we begin."

Hagrid chimed in. "I had personal charge of Professor Snape after he got back from You-Know-Who, and I can personally vouch that he's given up a lot for us. And he didn't even know us then."

Moody, too, stepped over to Dumbledore's side with a gruff, "I'm for him," while Lupin tried to persuade Black, "If you'd just take the time to hear what they have to say..." The other members of the Order preferred to wait for more information.

"Very well," Dumbledore sighed. "Severus, show them the mark."

Snape reluctantly removed his jacket and rolled up the left sleeve of his shirt. The dark mark curled there, powerful and ugly.

Emmeline Vance reached out to touch it - almost. "Is it a tattoo?" she asked.

"More of a brand," Snape answered. "It's burned in."

That sparked the interest of Diggle and Podmore, who both now moved in for a closer look. "What exactly," said Podmore, "is the function of the mark?"

"Identification. Two Death Eaters could recognize each other from the mark. One of its main purposes is that it allows the Dark Lord to summon us. He touches the mark of one, and all are summoned."

"What do you feel when you're summoned?" asked Vance.

"It burns. The mark becomes black, and it burns. You don't always know where you're going. You just concentrate on the mark and apparate. It's a security measure. Then, you can be punished through the mark."

"How does that work?" Podmore asked.

"It's quite drastic. It's a total breakdown of bodily functions and can be inflicted at a distance. The Dark Lord seldom uses it, and then only when other methods are considered insufficient."

Lupin looked at Snape in sudden comprehension. "You mean if he found out you were betraying him, he could kill even while you were here with us?"

In the silence, they all looked at him. "Yes," Snape replied simply, and left it at that.

There was a period when none of them spoke. Then Dumbledore made the next move.

"I should like Severus Snape to be admitted into the Order of the Phoenix. He has already fought the first skirmish of this war by going into Voldemort's inner circle and being accepted back as a loyal Death Eater. He is now in a position to provide us with valuable information, and is willing to do so."

Lupin turned to Snape. "Is that true? Are you willing to be a spy?"

"I haven't actually been asked, though I suppose it was implicit in everything we were doing this year."

Dumbledore snorted. "Very well, Severus. Will you spy for me again as you did fourteen years ago?"

Before Snape could answer, several voices interrupted.

"Fourteen years ago...?"

"What do you mean, again?"

"He's spied for us already?"

Dumbledore held up a hand, and the room became still. "I am sorry," he said. "I thought that was understood. Fourteen, almost fifteen years ago, Severus deserted Lord Voldemort and came over to our side. His reasons were personal, and I was convinced they were sincere. At great personal risk, the greatest that any of us could ever face, he returned to his former master to spy out information for me. It was Severus who told us that Lord Voldemort was seeking James and Lily Potter, and it was Severus who suggested they be hidden by the Fidelius charm."

The effect of this information was to soften the attitude of every member of the Order. Even Sirius Black slipped into a corner and was suddenly silent. In that silence, Dumbledore again said, "I should like Severus Snape to be admitted into the Order of the Phoenix."

This time there was general assent. Most of the other members came forward to shake Snape's hand and wish him well. After a few minutes, Dumbledore spoke again.

"And now we must settle on our priorities for the coming weeks."

A heated debate ensued, in which Snape took no part. It was decided that the ranks of the Order needed to be replenished, and candidates were suggested, starting with McGonagall, Flitwick, and the Weasleys, all of whom were already acquainted with the Order's work. Members were assigned to recruit newcomers to the ranks, and an initial system of intelligence gathering from muggle sources was outlined, with Lupin and Moody in charge.

"And of course," added Dumbledore, "Severus will be providing us with inside information."

All eyes again on him, Snape demurred. "That depends on the Dark Lord," he said. "If he calls me, I can get information. If he doesn't, I can't."

It was Elphias Doge who asked the question. "Why do you still call him 'Dark Lord' when you're with us?"

Snape regarded him calmly. "It's another function of the mark," he said. "Hearing the Dark Lord's name brings pain. Every time you say his name, the mark burns. Why else do you think we started to convince everyone to say 'He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,' or 'You-Know-Who'? Pure self protection."

Business now apparently concluded, Black stepped forward again. "I'd be honored if you'd all stay for lunch. It'll be served immediately in the dining room." He glanced around the room as he said this, but managed to avoid looking directly at Snape.

As the group began to file into the dining room, Snape turned quizzically to Dumbledore. "Why is he...?"

"I must have forgotten to mention, Severus. This is Black's home. That rather noisy portrait in the entry is his mother. It has been closed and boarded up for some time, but he is trying to restore it to its former condition."

Snape gazed out the window for a moment. "I really need to be off," he said finally. "I have a lot to do, and I ate before I came. I'll just make my excuses to the host..."

Dumbledore moved in front of Snape, angry and speaking in a low, almost harsh voice. "You will go into that dining room now, and you will be polite, and you will eat his food. Before our absence becomes noticeable."

"Yes, Headmaster," said Snape, yet Dumbledore nonetheless waited for Snape to go first, practically herding him into the room where the others were seating themselves. Snape took a seat in the middle of the table, equidistant from Black and Dumbledore, between Vance and Diggle, and opposite Lupin.

When they were all seated, platters of food appeared on the table, indicating the presence of a house-elf, and the group helped themselves just as if they were back in the Great Hall at Hogwarts. Snape tried to convince Vance that he really wasn't hungry, but she insisted on serving him at the same time that she filled her own plate.

In the general and highly animated conversation that ensued, Snape found that he was able to push the food around on his plate while apparently listening raptly to what Diggle had to say, or pause with a bite halfway to his mouth, then put the fork down as he made a comment in return, and generally appear to be eating without actually eating. The others refilled their plates a few times, and he reached for the platters as well, so that only someone paying careful attention would realize that he'd taken no bite of food nor any sip of drink.

Dumbledore was paying attention. So, it seemed, were Black and Lupin. Dumbledore was clearly seething under his mild demeanor, while Black was having a harder time concealing his anger, and Lupin merely looked disappointed. It was Black who decided to press the issue.

Rising from his chair, he rang a small bell, and goblets of wine appeared in front of the guests. "Lady and gentlemen," Black said as he picked up his goblet, "I'd like to propose..."

Snape suddenly gasped, clutched his left arm, and pushed away from the table. As he stood, he doubled over in pain. The others jumped to their feet in shock as Snape began to stammer, "I have to go... I have to go now... He's calling..."

A furious Dumbledore pushed his way to Snape's side and grabbed his arm, unbuttoning the shirt cuff and pushing the sleeve up to the elbow. The dark mark, which had earlier had the appearance of a greenish tattoo, was now black, and the skin around it had developed small blisters. The snake protruding from the skull's mouth seemed to undulate slightly, and there was the faint smell of burned flesh.

"I have to go..." Snape gasped as Dumbledore's expression changed from anger to concern. "Last time I had an excuse for being late. I don't have an excuse now. If I don't go... go now..."

"You have an excuse," said Dumbledore. "You were with us. Is that not part of your job?"

Snape nodded in understanding. "I can't go from here, though. I think he can trace it. I have to make another stop." He was getting the pain under control. Around him the members of the Order looked worried, even frightened. None of them had ever before seen the mark function.

"Hagrid," said Dumbledore, "take him out into the yard. You can apparate from there, Severus. I leave it up to you how you handle the destination."

The rest parted as Hagrid steered Snape toward the rear of the house and the door that led into the yard in the back. Letting Hagrid's bulk shield him from possible spectators in the other houses, Snape took out his wand, concentrated on Pendle Hill, and apparated.

For just a moment Snape stood on the side of Pendle Hill, looking around at the open heath and the scattered villages below, a breeze drying the perspiration on his brow. Then he took a deep breath, concentrated on the mark itself, and apparated again.

This time he was outside an old warehouse in Southwark, across the Thames from the Tower of London. The building was surrounded by a high wooden fence and appeared from the outside to be derelict or about to undergo restoration, as had already happened with many of the old factories and warehouses in the area.

Other Death Eaters were also there, and more were arriving. The little group nodded to each other and entered the building. Its interior had not been magically reformed, so clearly this was a place for one meeting only, thereafter to be abandoned. As the group gathered in the center of the large, open floor, the Dark Lord appeared among them.

Snape took his place in the circle, all in all a remarkably egalitarian group. Most of the highest echelon of the Death Eaters was currently in Azkaban prison, and had been there for over thirteen years. Of those that gathered, only Lucius Malfoy and Walden Macnair were really top level.

When the Dark Lord began to speak, Snape had a most remarkable sense of déjà vu, for he talked of recruiting more members and gathering intelligence. \emph{I just came from this meeting.} One by one, the group gathered there approached, knelt to the Dark Lord, and gave a report. One thing that struck Snape was the sense that they were trying not to attract attention, a most unDeath-Eaterlike attitude.

\emph{It's a little like flying below the radar. The Ministry doesn't want to notice us, so if we're discreet, the Ministry won't notice us. That way we build our strength in the shadows until we're strong enough to fight. How will Fudge react, I wonder, when he finds out how much comfort he's given to the enemy?}

Then the Dark Lord said, "Now we shall hear from our brother Severus."

Startled out of his reverie, Snape advanced into the center of the circle, knelt before his Lord, and established eye contact. This would be, however, no brutal invasion of his mind, but a gentle surface reading. He calmly awaited the questions.

"You came in today from Pendle."

"Yes, Lord."

"But that was not where you received our summons."

"No, Lord."

"Where did you receive our summons?"

"In London, north of King's Cross Station."

"Be more specific."

"Lord, I cannot."

There was an intake of breath all around, and the Dark Lord rose from his seat. "Why can you not tell us? Explain." he said, and there was death in his tone.

"Lord, I was invited this morning by Dumbledore to a meeting of the Order of the Phoenix. They are your great enemies, and will move Heaven and Earth to destroy you. I was told on arrival that the place was under a Fidelius Charm, and I was given the choice to become part of the secret or to be banished from it forever. Having no other instructions, I chose the way that would bring you more information."

"Who is the Secret Keeper?"

"Albus Dumbledore."

"Then you attended this meeting."

"Yes, Lord."

"Tell us."

"There are only a few of the order left. They are Albus Dumbledore, Alastor Moody, Dumbledore's brother Aberforth, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Dedalus Diggle, Elphias Doge, Rubeus Hagrid, Sturgis Podmore and Emmeline Vance." Out of the corner of his eye, Snape saw Pettigrew confirming the tally on his fingers. "They are bound to your destruction."

"What did they discuss at their meeting?"

"The same thing that we are discussing here. They wish to recruit more members, and they wish to gather more intelligence. They are angry that the Ministry doesn't publicly acknowledge your return, Lord, since they believe that public outcry against you would help their cause."

"Did they name potential new members?"

"No, Lord."

"Why did you come from Pendle?"

"I feared they would track my destination, so I put a stop in between. That way they couldn't discover the place of our meeting."

"You have answered well. Join your fellows and listen further."

Snape apparated back to Pendle Hill near evening, and paused for a moment. London or Scotland? Maybe it didn't matter as long as he was thinking of the right person. Pointing his wand north, he concentrated on Dumbledore and the message 'No contact of any kind for seventy-two hours. Watch Potter.' Immediately the misty little fox streamed out of the end of the wand, circled, and headed south to London. \emph{It knows where he is. That's good information to have.}

A moment later Snape was inside his own kitchen at Spinner's End making a cup of tea and thinking of what to fix for supper. He was very hungry, having had nothing to eat all day. Not five minutes after his arrival, there was a distinctive 'pop' outside the house. Snape ignored it. \emph{If they want to come in, they can knock.}

In fact, nobody knocked. Not the least surprised, Snape busied himself with a dish of lamb curry. One of the advantages of being both muggle-raised and a Potions Master was that cooking was relatively easy. Snape knew, as a matter of professional expertise, the qualities of every herb and spice there was, and enjoyed combining them in different types of food. He never used magic, as he never used it when mixing potions. He rather despised wizards who were helpless without a wand in their hands.

Snape ate in the kitchen, then went into the front room for a glass of wine and a book. He didn't close the curtains, as he had not in the kitchen either, since this evening he wanted to be seen relaxing at home. Anyone outside would know that no magic had been performed in or near the house for hours, and he wanted it to stay that way.

The surveillance went on for more than two days. Neither Pettigrew nor the Carrows were expert at this kind of thing, apparating and disapparating too near the house to remain undetected. Others were more subtle. Snape had a little fun leading them out onto the heath while he gathered herbs - watching a wizard trying to hide behind gorse can be highly amusing - but by the third day he was tired of their company.

Luckily, by the third day it seemed they were tired of him.

After going all morning without any trace of someone following him, Snape finally decided that the testing period, at least this one, was over. Late that afternoon he apparated to the rear of St. Nicholas church in Liverpool, not wanting to make Pendle Hill a too regular stop, and from there to an alley he'd noticed while he was with Dumbledore in London, about a five-minute walk from Grimmauld Place. He hadn't sent a patronus ahead for fear that someone might still be watching.

Arriving in Grimmauld Place, Snape cautiously approached number twelve, which appeared on the outside to be just as deserted as it had three days earlier. Climbing the steps, he paused, then knocked quietly at the door.

It was opened by Sirius Black.

Snape backed away a step, but Black opened the door wider. "Get in off the street," he said quickly. "Dumbledore's inside. Be quiet and don't wake Mother."

As Snape slipped into the house, he said, "Any word from our friends at Azkaban?" At Black's low growl, he realized his mistake. "No, really. Has anything happened at Azkaban?"

Black stared at him for a moment, then seized Snape's arm and pulled him into the parlor. The little group gathered there looked up in surprise. "He says something's supposed to happen at Azkaban," Black told them.

Snape was ushered to an empty chair at once. "We were a bit worried when we got your message," said Dumbledore as the group pulled their chairs into a tighter circle. "We were afraid he was getting suspicious."

"He's always suspicious. There was a round-the-clock watch on me for nearly sixty hours. They seem to have decided I'm not going to bolt and run."

"What news?"

"That's what I wanted to ask you. He wants the Potter boy. He's furious that Potter escaped last month, and he's been worried that the Ministry would start hunting him again before the organization was complete. The fact that the Ministry's been doing nothing is a godsend for him. But he still wants Potter. He'd prefer to kidnap the boy, but barring that he'll be content to kill him. That's why I told you to watch him."

"Any idea how they intend to do it?"

"Not really. I'm not in the inner circle. I do know that he's trying to breach security at Azkaban and draw out some of the dementors. That's why I asked about news from there." That sentence was addressed to Black. "If Azkaban is normal, then he hasn't succeeded yet."

"Assuming the Ministry would make the news public," said Dumbledore grimly. "Well, as long as we have you, I presume there's more to report..."

Tea appeared, and as the others helped themselves to sandwiches and sweets, Dumbledore placed a cup on a small table next to Snape. "Sandwiches?" he asked.

"No, thank you," replied Snape. "I already had something. The tea smells good, though."

"Now," continued Dumbledore, "tell us what's happening with Vol-... with the other side."

"The organization seems to be in disarray. I wasn't the only one who answered the first summons late. He had panicky Death Eaters showing up for days after his reappearance, especially in the lower ranks. The ones in real trouble are the ones who simply ran. I'm afraid Karkaroff has definitely been counted as one of them."

A knock at the front door interrupted him, and Snape waited while several more people, among them Molly Weasley and her son Charlie, entered the room. Snape was introduced to Mundungus Fletcher, Arabella Figg, and Nymphadora Tonks, whom he remembered as one of his students. After they were seated, he resumed.

"He was concerned at the beginning, when Potter escaped, that the Ministry would start a sweep of the country trying to round up everyone who was ever connected with the Death Eaters. That the Ministry has done nothing is a source of great pleasure to the Dark Lord and the upper circle. I'm not sure what Fudge thinks is happening, but he wouldn't be at all happy to hear how he was talked about at that last meeting.

"There are several things that have priority. The first is to lie low while we... they organize. He's planning to restart the branches in Norwich, Lincoln, Cardiff, York, and Glasgow. Lieutenants haven't been assigned yet. One of the biggest obstacles is that so many of his top people are in Azkaban.

"So another priority is getting our... his people out of Azkaban. For those who just arrived, there was some talk about siphoning off a few of the dementors to use as bodyguards or agents, which is why I asked if there was any news from Azkaban. But assuming Fudge knew he'd lost a couple, would he make it public?"

"Good points," commented Dumbledore. "It seems we have to keep an eye open for activity all over Britain, and it will probably be low-key, hard to pinpoint. And we have to keep our ears open at the Ministry. Molly, Arthur will be very useful there."

Molly Weasley nodded, and Charlie looked very determined and proud.

"There's something that bothers me, though," said Doge. "Why do keep saying 'we' when you talk about them? You're supposed to be..."

"Stow it, Elphias," growled Moody. "Leave him be. Better to automatically say 'we' and 'us.' Here it's a small slip that can be corrected. He slips with them and we lose a source of information."

Snape nodded his thanks to Moody and continued. "As I said before, another thing, more personal and therefore more immediate, is that he wants Potter. He was furious when Potter escaped, and he's determined to get him back. I believe he'll try several attempts to lay his hands on the boy before he gives the order that it's permissible to kill him, but I have no idea how much time that will take.

"Several of you need to know that I gave the Dark Lord your names, those of you I met here three days ago. One of the people prominent around the Dark Lord, though he seems to have no real hierarchical standing, is Peter Pettigrew. While I was giving my report, he was keeping track, and I felt I had no choice. As I named you, he kept count. I was afraid that if I omitted anyone, I would be placed in danger. I understood that he had once been a member of the Order, and would know your names in any case. Those were the only names I mentioned."

"It was wisely done," Lupin said. "Peter was in on everything we did from the beginning. He'd know all of us and probably gave our names to... him long ago."

"May I ask what your job is?" It was the first time Black had spoken since they entered the parlor.

"The same as it was before, fifteen years ago. I have three major duties. First, I'm in charge of the potions. We don't have a permanent headquarters yet, but when we do I'll have a laboratory that needs to be stocked with supplies. I've started collecting things, and I'm drawing up a list of materials. The organization is short of funds, but Lucius Malfoy isn't, and I'll be able to call on him to buy the things I can't gather myself.

"My second job is curses. If the Organization needs a curse for a special job, and the curse doesn't exist, I have to try to invent it. The first two I did were a way to sneak past dogs, and a way to walk silently on leaves."

"That was you!" cried Vance. "I always wondered how they got past those dogs."

"That was while I still actually worked for him. My third job is combat training. Self-defensive techniques."

Lupin laughed heartily. "I can vouch from long experience that you were always good at that."

The report now finished, the members of the Order began to chat, and to look forward to supper. Snape rose from his chair.

"If you will excuse me, I should be leaving. I need to visit Diagon Alley, which will be my justification in case the Dark Lord asks why I came to London, and I have a tremendous amount of work to do to prepare the potions laboratory."

They wished him well, though no one seemed particularly sorry that he was going, and Snape quietly left the house.

The tea on the table next to his chair remained untouched.

When next Snape was summoned to the Dark Lord, it was to an older area of Croydon, south of London, where he was met by Macnair, who handed him a folded piece of paper.

"Don't tell me. Let me guess. A Fidelius Charm?"

Macnair chortled. "You put a bee in his bonnet, I'm thinking. Read it, then walk down that street. It'll be on the left.

'It' was an old brick building still grimed with streaks of London soot from decades of air pollution. Snape's parents had remembered the famous 'pea soup' fogs of London from their rare visits to the capital in their youth, but by the time Snape was born, strict controls had cleaned both air and water, though traces still remained on the walls of buildings. Snape took a deep breath and went to the door.

The meeting was short. Each Death Eater was assigned a part of the new headquarters to prepare for the long battle ahead. Snape soon found himself in the long rectangular room that was to be his new laboratory. One wall was a row of large, dirty windows with a view of train tracks. \emph{Not bad. Lots of light, even if a little noisy.} Sections of the windows could be opened, providing good ventilation.

The first thing Snape checked out was the electric wiring. Nothing electronic could function at Hogwarts because of the heavy magical protection surrounding the Castle and grounds, but no such powerful charms were in place here. To his great delight, Snape found that the room had a large number of outlets, and a quick check of the boxes showed that it was wired for high wattage and amps.

The second thing was a gas line, but there he was disappointed. \emph{An easy problem to resolve, though. I'll just fuel the Bunsen burners with propane tanks.}

The third thing was water, and there he was not disappointed, for several areas of the room had plumbing and the taps were already installed. \emph{I wonder what this room used to be used for?}

Snape immediately requested that magic be banned from the laboratory. When questioned, he got technical. "There's going to be a lot of delicate equipment in there. Not to mention tanks of combustible gases and liquids that could explode if their containers are compromised. Besides, have you ever seen what a simple Lumos charm can do to the cathodes and anodes when you're performing electrolysis? It isn't pretty."

Since the Dark Lord had no idea what cathodes, anodes, or electrolysis were, he agreed to Snape's request.

Safe now in his own domain, protected from magical interference by order of the Dark Lord himself, Snape began to set things up, his first order to Malfoy being rows of counters fitted with long drawers and sinks, cabinets for equipment, stools, a half dozen Bunsen burners, three fire extinguishers (which made several of the Death Eaters decidedly nervous), and cases of test tubes, beakers, pipettes, glass rods, jars, vials, flasks, and even some cauldrons. There were, after all, a few potions that could only be made in an iron cauldron. \emph{And I am going to go out and get lab coats!}

Dumbledore was forbidden to send patronuses to Snape. "All I need is for a silver phoenix to be hovering around Croydon. For the next couple of weeks I need to spend most of my time setting up the lab. My first assignment is to stock a medical area for those injured in the line of duty. After that, I'll have more free time."

Dumbledore peered over the top of his glasses. They were sitting in a pub at the bottom of Ludgate Hill, far more private than the house at Grimmauld Place. "Should I be concerned that you seem to be enjoying this far too much?"

"What do you mean?"

"You've been going on in exquisite detail about every facet of this laboratory of yours. I seem to remember that it is an old, and at one time deeply cherished dream. Might not this siren be seducing you away from us?"

"Don't worry, Professor. Even in his presence, it's impossible to forget who and what he is and what he's done. Using his own resources to destroy him is just part of the poetry of the whole situation."

"I do hope that is true."

At the Croydon headquarters, Snape ran into Pettigrew from time to time. They even began to chat.

"I hear you did great service for the Dark Lord in the past, giving him information. Is it true you were Secret Keeper for the Potters?"

Pettigrew grinned. "The crowning point of my career so far. The Dark Lord was very pleased with that tidbit."

"How did you get to be Secret Keeper?"

"Pure luck, actually. It was going to be Sirius, but at the last moment he convinced James that it should be me. He was afraid that he was too obvious a choice and worried that he could be forced to talk."

"So in a way, Black decided that you should be Secret Keeper. Interesting." Snape stored the information, to be retrieved and used later.

It took the last two weeks of July to set up the laboratory, primarily because Snape wouldn't allow magic. First there was the job of cleaning and painting. It was hard work, but a ladder, a bucket, a mop and a variety of sponges soon had the windows gleaming and the floor and walls spotless. It was then that Snape discovered that somewhere in the intervening twenty years paint had been developed that took far less time to dry. He was enthralled by muggle ingenuity.

Some of the stronger, lower level Death Eaters were called in to position the counters and cabinets, which took two days. Snape had even purchased do-it-yourself books on electrical wiring and plumbing. Fortunately for the borough of Croydon, the wiring was in good shape, and hooking the sinks up to the existing plumbing was fairly simple, as was figuring out how to use a propane tank.

One thing that created quite a stir was testing one of the fire extinguishers in the basement. Nothing could have convinced the other Death Eaters of the strictness of the magic prohibition like Snape's determination to learn how to put out a fire with foam shot from a red cylinder. The laboratory was beginning to develop an almost legendary mystique before it even went into operation.

At last Snape was able to don his new immaculate white lab coat and begin unpacking and arranging his books and equipment. Many of the books were from his youth when he'd believed becoming a scientist was more than a pipe dream. Others were recently purchased, including pharmaceutical texts from the University of London bookstore.

The Dark Lord himself visited the newly set up laboratory, and while it was clear he didn't quite place potions making above magic, he was pleased to have an establishment in the forefront of development in the wizarding world.

Snape did not return home to Spinner's End in all this time. Instead, one corner of the lab was set up with privacy curtains like a hospital, and had a cot, a night stand, a lamp, and a small bookcase with some light reading.

At the end of July, while up late at night tending the first batch of a bone-setting potion, Snape found himself making a list. It was a list of names:

Tom Riddle

Peter Pettigrew

Severus Snape

Sirius Black

James Potter, deceased

Albus Dumbledore

Sibyll Trelawney

Harry Potter (?)

After studying the list for a while, still occasionally stirring the potion, he folded it carefully, wrote 'People responsible for the death of Lily Evans' on the outside, and slipped it behind the books he kept in his sleeping area.

From that moment Snape began to feel the presence of Lily strongly in the laboratory. He did not, however, talk to her. This was partly because he didn't want to reveal his secret to anyone who might happen to come in, and partly because he thought she would probably not approve of his list.

The next day was July 31. Snape requested a meeting with the Dark Lord.

"Tell us your wish, Potions Master."

"It's customary for the teachers at Hogwarts to arrive at the school on the first of August each year to review the coming year and to prepare their work areas. It would look odd if I weren't there. Normally, too, I live at the school from that point. I would be able to return here for a few hours each day, but in order to maintain my cover, I should be at Hogwarts most of the time."

"Will your work here suffer?"

"It will go slowly. Since we are keeping a low profile for the time being, however, I don't think it will affect day-to-day operations in any way."

"Very well. You have our permission to go to Hogwarts."

The next morning Snape packed his usual Gladstone bag. Leaving the Croydon offices, he went to the railway station and entered the men's room. It was empty, so Snape had no trouble concentrating on the outskirts of Hogsmeade and apparating.&#13;
