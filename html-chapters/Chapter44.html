    <h2>Chapter 44: Chapter 44 – Not What Meets the Eye</h2>
    <div class="storytext xcontrast_txt nocopy" id="storytext"><p><strong>If You Are Ready...: Not What Meets the Eye</strong></p><p><em>Monday, August 1, 1994 (two days after the last quarter)</em></p><p>Professor Severus Snape apparated just outside the village of Hogsmeade at 9:05 on Monday morning, the first of August 1994. He was beginning his fourteenth year as the Potions instructor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and he was not looking forward to it.</p><p>The primary reason he was not looking forward to it was a student by the name of Harry Potter. It would be Potter's fourth year at Hogwarts, and for Professor Snape every year of Potter's presence had gotten progressively worse to the point where the Professor was beginning to doubt whether or not he would survive.</p><p>The first one to greet Snape's arrival was Alastor Moody. This was a yearly ritual, since Moody was looking forward to welcoming Snape at Azkaban prison the instant Snape slipped from under the protection of Hogwarts' headmaster, Albus Dumbledore.</p><p>"Top o' the morning to you, Snape old boy," Moody called cheerfully from a bench as Snape entered the village on his way to the school gates.</p><p>"You're not Irish," was Snape's response.</p><p>"And how would you be knowing that, me boyo?"</p><p>"If you were Irish, you'd be less careful about what you drank."</p><p>Moody drew a hip flask from his pocket and took a swig. "You'd better watch yourself," he winked, "or you'll be up for cultural defamation. Are you dropping by to visit this year? Your room is still ready."</p><p>"We caught the show off-Broadway last year. Wouldn't want to overdo a good thing."</p><p>"Oh, dear. And the dementors worked up a couple of new routines just for you. They'll be so disappointed."</p><p>"Better them than me."</p><p>"Dumbledore talk to you yet about Dark Arts?"</p><p>Snape was suddenly wary. "I've not had that privilege yet, no."</p><p>"At last! I know something you don't know about Hogwarts. Sleep well, Snape. Look for me in the gloamin'."</p><p>"You're not Scottish either."</p><p>But Moody was gone, and Snape made his way up to the gate where Filch was waiting to let him in. <em>What could Moody possibly know about the new assignment for Defense against the Dark Arts? He's just trying to get on my nerves.</em></p><p>xxxxxxxxxx</p><p>Snape had to spend the next month with the other teachers getting ready for school to start on September first. In his case the work was light, for Snape always ended a school year with his accounts in order and his materials on hand. There were a few perishables that had to be ordered last minute, but basically everything was in place.</p><p>Apart from his own classroom, however, Snape found things at the school very much not in order.</p><p>The first concern was the announcement at the first staff meeting of the first day that Hogwarts was going to hold the first Triwizard Tournament in a few hundred years. This meant the hosting of representatives from both Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, the canceling of the Quidditch matches, and the disruption of classes.</p><p>Equally momentous and equally disruptive was the Quidditch World Cup final game that was to be held on August twenty-second. Snape himself had little use for Quidditch, though as the head of Slytherin house he had to support the Slytherin team, and he was a touch impatient with the other instructors for being so immersed in everything to do with the World Cup. It made for very boring mealtime conversations.</p><p>The last concern, the one that would grow to override all the others, started out small about a week before the World Cup game.</p><p>xxxxxxxxxx</p><p><em>They were having a party. Wilkes wanted him to play the piano because Avery was dancing with a lampshade on his head. 'I don't know how to play,' he answered, but it didn't matter since the piano could play itself. Everybody was slightly drunk and laughing very loudly. He was happy and enjoying the party, except the corner of the room was dark. In the darkness there was a small brazier where they all got their tattoos. He was pleased with his tattoo - the snake was green and silver with red eyes. The snake couldn't sit still, though, and every time it twisted its body, his left arm itched. 'Stop wiggling,' he told it - </em>and woke up.</p><p>Lying there in the darkness in his bedroom, Snape realized he was rubbing his left arm because it was itching. He picked up the wand that lay by his bedside and said, "Lumos." In the faint green light he examined the arm. The tattoo of a skull with a snake coming out of its mouth appeared no different than it ever did, but for some reason the skin where the snake was tattooed itched slightly. Snape rubbed it thoughtfully.</p><p><em>Why would it do that when it hasn't bothered me for nearly thirteen years? Not even when the Dark Lord was watching me from the back of Quirrell's head did it affect the Mark in any way. What's happening now?</em></p><p>Breakfast without the students to watch was much less formal than during the school year. Snape wished the others good morning, and went straight to Dumbledore.</p><p>"May I speak with you privately when you're finished?"</p><p>"Certainly. Lately, I must say, I am pleased when you wish to speak to me at all."</p><p>"This might be important."</p><p>"Pity. I was rather hoping it would be social. Ah well, I take what I can get."</p><p>Up in Dumbledore's tower office, the headmaster examined Snape's arm carefully. "It does not look any different to me."</p><p>"Nor to me, but it's never itched before. When he calls us, it burns. I don't know what this means."</p><p>"I think we need to take it very seriously, even though the last I heard Riddle was in Albania. One never knows. Things could develop slowly and take years to reach a crisis, or they could engulf us overnight."</p><p>"What should I do?"</p><p>Dumbledore regarded his potions master with a touch of sadness. "I had hoped, after all these years, that I would never again need to require you to put yourself in danger for me. Now I must ask you to prepare yourself for the possibility."</p><p>"Wasn't that why you always wanted me to keep my opinions... ambiguous?"</p><p>"Well, yes. One never throws a useful tool away when even the smallest chance still exists that it might come in handy. Nonetheless, I would have been more pleased if the eventuality had never arisen."</p><p>"So, what do I do?"</p><p>"If you were to ever come face to face with your old master, would it help to have prepared yourself mentally for the ordeal, or does that just happen instinctively?"</p><p>Snape studied his hands for a moment. "I think it would help to have memories and images at the forefront of my mind. It's been a long time. He'd want to know about the whole thirteen years. I'm not sure I have enough to convince him I'm not holding anything back."</p><p>"Would it help if I yelled at you - humiliated you in front of the rest of the staff - treated you like scum?" Dumbledore was smiling, but the import of his words was not a laughing matter. Memories handed to a skilled legilimens could not be fabricated out of thin air. They had to be actual memories.</p><p>"It may come to that. Let me see what I have of my own first, though. I'd hate to shock McGonagall at the breakfast table."</p><p>Back in his own rooms, Snape began a thorough and methodical ordering of the rooms and boxes of his mind. Images of Dumbledore, of the other teachers, of students, of visitors, of his home. There were things that could be used in multiple ways, and things that he could never let the Dark Lord even glimpse. It amazed him sometimes how much the human mind could store.</p><p>After a couple of hours of careful meditation, it was clear that the process would take weeks, months to do right. <em>Keep your eyes open and wits about you, Severus. Who knows what images might pop up that you could store for the benefit of the Dark Lord?</em></p><p>The whole of the next week seemed to center on Quidditch. It was Ireland this, and Bulgaria that, and what a great seeker Krum was, even if he couldn't hold a candle to Eunice Murray in her prime and, of course, odds and betting. Snape was completely bored by the whole thing until Flitwick and Sprout got into a screaming match the Friday before the World Cup. Sticking his fingers in his ears, Snape realized that he had some wonderful mental images of angry Hogwarts teachers with no clue of what they were saying.</p><p>For the next three days Snape turned into the worst sort of argument starter - one who gets two other people at it, then sits back and watches.</p><p>"Minerva, weren't you saying that the Pride of Portree were the best team in Britain, because Poppy told me yesterday it was the Montrose Magpies."</p><p>"No, I'm sure it was Pomona who mentioned that the Chudley Cannons never won a championship where they didn't cheat at least twice in the game."</p><p>"Puddlemere had a winning season last year? Then Filius must have been joking when he said that hadn't happened since 1372."</p><p>By the day of the World Cup match, Snape had stored away scores of choice images of discord at Hogwarts for the potential future delectation of the Dark Lord.</p><p>The evening of the actual game, however, Snape chose to spend reading in his own rooms, Professor McGonagall having acquired a radio, which was set up in the Great Hall where the other teachers listened avidly to the broadcast from the stadium.</p><p>xxxxxxxxxx</p><p>"Severus! Severus! Have you heard what happened? How unutterably awful!"</p><p>Snape paused to listen to Professor Sinistra's news, which turned out to be more disturbing than he would have imagined.</p><p>"Death Eaters! Death Eaters torturing innocent muggles and setting the Dark Mark in the sky! And the Ministry absolutely powerless to do anything to stop it. So horrible!"</p><p>That was indeed a horrible piece of news, and Snape hurried over to Professor McGonagall, who was buried in the Daily Prophet.</p><p>"Spill. What happened?" he said as he sat beside her and reached for toast, sausages, and eggs.</p><p>"Disgusting spectacle, that's all I have to say about it. A crowd of masked wizards attacked a family of muggles after the game last night and tormented them, holding them suspended upside down in the air and bouncing them around. Two of them were children. They must have been terrified."</p><p>Snape froze, his toast halfway to his mouth. "Upside down? Up in the air?" <em>Oh, no. That sounds like my spell. The one I invented that James Potter stole in fifth year and taught to the entire school.</em></p><p>"Like sacks of grain. Not only that, someone set the Dark Mark up over the woods, and there was whole-scale panic in the crowd. It's lucky people weren't trampled to death. Ministry wallahs all over the place, and no one under arrest. It's shameful!"</p><p>"Wallahs?"</p><p>"Ach, I'm showing my age. An expression from when we were still an empire. The Raj, you know. Officials - officials all over the place and no one under arrest."</p><p>"The Dark Mark's set up when someone's killed. Was anyone...?"</p><p>"No. No, thank goodness. Just scared. But who would think there was such a large crowd of you-know-who's supporters still around and willing to risk exposure with a prank like that? And then get away with it?"</p><p>"It's a sad world we live in, Minerva."</p><p>Dumbledore entered the Great Hall then, glanced around, and raised his eyebrows in Snape's direction.</p><p>"Excuse me, Minerva," Snape said as he rose from his unfinished breakfast. "I think the Headmaster wants to see me."</p><p>"Better you than me," replied McGonagall, who went back to reading the newspaper.</p><p>As Snape and Dumbledore met at the entrance to the Hall, Dumbledore said quietly, "I assume you have heard."</p><p>"Yes, sir," Snape answered.</p><p>"Let us go to my office then. This news disturbs me greatly. Especially coming on top of what you told me last week."</p><p>"I don't think the Dark Lord was behind it." Snape was sitting in a comfortable chair by the fire in Dumbledore's office, drinking a cup of Turkish coffee. "It was far too amateurish. And he always wanted the Dark Mark to mean something specific, terrifying - not an empty threat, but a deed already accomplished."</p><p>"And yet we have followers of... Riddle... who are no longer afraid to show themselves openly. Have they felt what you have felt?"</p><p>"It's very probable. I've no special link to the Dark Lord. They may sense he's nearer and let their close proximity at the World Cup get the better of their judgment. We have no proof the Dark Lord... Riddle, would even have approved."</p><p>"Who might have been involved?"</p><p>"How would I know?" At this, Dumbledore had such a hangdog look of disappointment that Snape relented. A little. "Of those that I personally know are still around and not in Azkaban - Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, Avery, Macnair, Nott... but he never let any of us know the extent of the organization. We knew our contacts - that was all. I was London and the south. Silly, really, because I was born in Lancashire. Those who might have come from the Midlands, Anglia, the Marches, the North... I really don't know."</p><p>"Another reason for eliminating as many Death Eaters as possible. Not only does it reduce Riddle's following, it forces the different regions of his organization to communicate with each other and to learn who the others are."</p><p>Snape eyed Dumbledore thoughtfully. "You're probably right but I, as a Death Eater, would still be intimidated from revealing myself to other parts of the organization. You get punished a lot less for inactivity than for the wrong kind of activity."</p><p>"A serious flaw. And a good piece of information to know." Dumbledore waited a moment, but Snape didn't elaborate. Finally Dumbledore voiced the thought. "He will not think that you have been engaged in the wrong kind of activity, will he?"</p><p>"I don't know. I won't know 'til I face him."</p><p>"When it is too late to back out."</p><p>"That's the game."</p><p>"How can I help?"</p><p>"Think of questions he'll ask that I can prepare answers to that mustn't sound prepared when I give them."</p><p>"Such a tangled web."</p><p>"One thing you can do right now."</p><p>"Which is...?"</p><p>"Try to read me. Be angry with me and try to read me. No joke, no games, really try."</p><p>"I do not think your idea will work. What I will do to read you and what Riddle will do are so completely different..."</p><p>"Your managerial style leaves a lot to be desired, you know." Snape stood to provoke Dumbledore, letting his voice drip with sarcasm. "You play your cards so close that one wonders if you really do have an idea or you're just bluffing so we'll think you're clever. Maybe that's why you play favorites so shamelessly. Half-baked plans turn out wrong, so you coddle the victims to assuage your own guilt. What a fraud you are. If you knew my real opinion of you..."</p><p>As Snape spoke, Dumbledore slowly turned to face him, eyes glinting with rising anger, and advanced until his blue eyes locked with Snape's black ones. Snape could feel the probes enter his brain, seeking, searching, examining. He began to close down, shutting thoughts and images into corners and nooks, setting up other images as blinds to conceal the doors, and still Dumbledore bored into him, forcing him to use every trick he knew to block without appearing to block, to hide without seeming to hide, to escape the grasping tentacles that were trying to rip his thoughts from him...</p><p>Then, quite suddenly, Dumbledore blinked and turned away. "You are very good," he said, smiling gently. "Do you think that will be enough to fool Riddle, or shall we do it a few more times, maybe in different places, to give you more images?"</p><p>"Not right away, certainly. It isn't my most pleasurable experience." Snape sat again, resting his head on his hands. "Though different images would help. He needs to know that you tried, and to know that you didn't succeed."</p><p>"I can do that. Just let me know whenever you are ready to give it another go."</p><p>"I will. Thank you, Professor." Snape left the office and went back to the Great Hall to see if any breakfast was left.</p><p>xxxxxxxxxx</p><p><em>Thursday, September 1, 1994 (three days after the last quarter)</em></p><p>"Has it ever actually rained for forty days and forty nights?" Snape asked of no one in particular as he watched the downpour from the windows of the Great Hall. It had been raining most of the week, and now on the morning of the first day of the autumn term it looked like the primeval deluge.</p><p>Professor Vector, the Arithmancy teacher, was the only one who appeared interested in the question. "I understand the number forty was just used to express 'a very long time,' ancient Hebrew being a language that dealt in specifics rather than generalities."</p><p>Snape's eyes widened. "Do you know Hebrew?" he asked.</p><p>"Cabalistic numerology is a major part of my subject. I thought you realized that." Vector grinned. "Hey, McGonagall! I just found out that I know something Snape doesn't!"</p><p>McGonagall joined them at the window. "I know lots of things Snape doesn't, but I can't tell him what they are because then he'd know them, too, and I'd lose my advantage."</p><p>"Well how do you know I don't know them then?"</p><p>"Tidbits gleaned from casual conversation. Every now and then you let something slip. I treasure those moments and store them in the recesses of my mind to pull out and hit you with if the opportunity ever arises."</p><p>"Has the opportunity ever arisen."</p><p>"Alas, no. But my luck is bound to change."</p><p>Dumbledore joined them. "Are we all picking on Severus again? We have to be careful about that or people are going to think we do not like him."</p><p>"But Headmaster," exclaimed Vector, "he twitches so nicely when we score a hit."</p><p>"I do not twitch."</p><p>"See! Just like that!"</p><p>"Changing the subject," interposed Dumbledore, "our new Defense against the Dark Arts instructor will not be arriving until this evening. He had a little trouble with an intruder at his home last night and now has to do the paperwork at the Ministry."</p><p>"Who is it, Headmaster?" Snape asked. "Considering our luck with the last two, I would prefer some time to set my affairs in order."</p><p>"Now, now. All in good time. He has asked to be seated next to you at dinner tonight, so you will learn all you need to learn then." Dumbledore nodded 'good morning' to the teachers and swept majestically out of the Hall.</p><p>"Well!" said McGonagall, "Is that a good or a bad omen?"</p><p>"I don't know." Snape was thoughtful. "At my annual get-together with Alastor Moody, he intimated that there was something interesting about the new person, but refused to tell me what it was."</p><p>"There, you see!" McGonagall was triumphant. "He doesn't want to lose his advantage either."</p><p>The rain continued into the night. Fortunately there was neither wind nor lightning yet, or the arrival of the first years by boat would have been rendered impossible. As it was, most of the students were drenched either by the downpour or by the antics of the poltergeist Peeves, who seemed to have recently discovered water balloons and was trying to initiate the entire school into their use.</p><p>The older students were seated at the long tables in the Great Hall, and at last Professor McGonagall led the procession of first years forward for the ceremony of sorting. Snape was generally only interested in the Sorting if the son or daughter of one of his old Death Eater colleagues was entering Hogwarts. Otherwise the children were total unknowns whose personalities would only emerge over time. And nothing now could surpass the Sorting of three years earlier, when Draco Malfoy, Neville Longbottom, and Harry Potter had all been sorted at the same time.</p><p>Sorting over, the feast began. Here again, there was nothing unusual except the weather. The electrical storm finally arrived - flashes of lightning and peals of thunder punctuated the meal. No longer at the far end of the table, Snape talked with Professor Sinistra on his right about the Magellan probe of Venus and about the comet Shoemaker-Levy, and from time to time leaned across the empty seat on his left to exchange a word with Dumbledore.</p><p>While the students were finishing dessert, Dumbledore rose to make announcements. All was pro forma, boring really, until he mentioned the canceling of the Quidditch matches. Dismayed cries arose from all four houses. Dumbledore was about to explain about the Triwizard Tournament when thunder crashed overhead and, as if on cue, the doors of the Great Hall flew open and the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher strode into their midst. Looking up at the sudden sound, Snape stared at the newcomer in utter shock.</p><p>It was Alastor Moody.</p><p>Moody's presence stunned the Hall into silence. Snape was used to Moody's appearance, having been greeted by the former auror on the first of August every year for well over a decade, but now he had a chance to look at Moody from a fresh point of view, through the students' eyes. It was truly amazing how ugly Moody was.</p><p>Moody approached the high table and shook Dumbledore's hand, the two of them murmuring a greeting that not even Snape, as close as he was, could hear well. Then Moody sat down. Sat down in the seat reserved for him next to Dumbledore. Sat down where he had requested Snape to be at his right hand. <em>Sneaky old coot. If he thinks I'm going to partner him at every meal for the whole year...</em></p><p>"So this is what you meant," Snape said quietly as Moody pulled a plate of food toward himself and began to eat, while Dumbledore rose to introduce him.</p><p>The plump sausage paused halfway to his mouth, and Moody turned to fix Snape with his enchanted eye. There was an instant, just an instant of contact, then Snape was shutting down, locking, and covering everything in his mind. He jerked his head away to break the link and stared at his own plate. Around him the Hall was silent, only Dumbledore and Hagrid clapping to welcome Moody, so Snape's own silence went unnoticed. Then Dumbledore began to explain the Triwizard Tournament, and Moody was forgotten in the rising excitement.</p><p>Not forgotten by Snape, though. <em>He knows. That blasted blue enchanted eye knows. He can read me.</em></p><p>It was only a short time until the feast was ended and students and teachers went to their dormitories and rooms for the night, but to Snape it seemed an eternity.</p><p>Once alone, Snape paced his office until past midnight.</p><p>It wasn't really that Moody could read him at will - Snape knew he could block the legilimency. But Moody would know that he was blocking it. Rather, that cursed eye would know he was blocking it. It was a frightening thought, for Snape's future safety depended on the Dark Lord's belief that he saw everything there was to see. <em>Dumbledore knows I can deceive him, but Dumbledore won't kill me for it.</em></p><p><em>Why didn't I ever notice this about Moody's eye before? Because he never tried to read me before. All those August meetings at Hogsmeade, and he never tried. What's changed since the beginning of August? The appearance of the Dark Mark. The fact that mine is itching. Maybe the prisoners in Azkaban feel it, too. Moody knows something's happening and he's watching me.</em></p><p><em>What other enchanted items am I powerless to deceive? Sneakoscopes? Foe-glasses? Pensieves? Items I don't even know exist? What if the Dark Lord uses one of these against me? No. No, he's too confident of his own powers to stoop to relying on gadgets. But one of the others might carry something that'll give me away.</em></p><p><em>I knew this was going to be a terrible year.</em></p><p>It was about to get worse.</p><p>The following day was the first of classes, and Snape spent most of his time in his dungeon classroom setting up the evaluatory labs and cleaning up the inevitable messes that occur when unprepared or out-of-practice wizards attempt a potion a touch too complex for them.</p><p>The final class of the day was finished, and Snape had set up for the next day's lessons. He was locking the classroom - a required precaution since there were poisonous materials inside - when he sensed a commotion from the entrance hall. Something was exciting the students.</p><p>As he made his way up from the dungeons, Snape heard McGonagall's voice ringing out. "We give detentions, Moody! Or speak to the offender's Head of house!"</p><p>Snape hurried forward, and had reached the entrance hall in time to catch Moody saying, "Now, your Head of house 'll be Snape, will it?" and Malfoy's affirmative response. "Another old friend," Moody continued. "I've been looking forward to a chat with old Snape... Come on, you..."</p><p>They met at the steps leading to the dungeon, Moody clutching Malfoy's arm as he dragged the boy along. Snape immediately averted his gaze to avoid the eye, and Moody laughed unpleasantly.</p><p>"I've got a matter to take up with you about this sneaking little coward," said Moody, shaking Malfoy just a bit, "and then I thought you and I might catch up on old times."</p><p>There was no way out of the encounter, so Snape led the way back to the dungeon office, Moody and Malfoy right behind him.</p><p>As soon as Snape's office door was unlocked, the burly Moody elbowed his way past the slender potions master, pulling Malfoy behind him. If the move was intended to intimidate Snape, it was successful, for he'd had far too many experiences of being bullied by larger classmates to be able to ignore physical pressure.</p><p>Moody shoved Malfoy into the chair next to the desk while he himself slouched into the more comfortable chair by the fireplace, lounging with his feet spread before the flames. "You've got some obnoxious, cowardly little beasts in your house, Head of Slytherin," he growled.</p><p>"What's Malfoy done now?" Snape stayed near the door, in a position where it would not be easy for Moody to establish eye contact without turning around.</p><p>"Attacked another student with a spell from behind. Tried to get him in the back. A lot like his father, this one. He's a back-stabber, too, Lucius is."</p><p>"Who did he attack?"</p><p>"Should it matter? Harry Potter."</p><p>"So is that why McGonagall was upset?"</p><p>"She didn't approve of my disciplinary techniques."</p><p>"Which were?"</p><p>"I turned him into a ferret and bounced him around the entrance hall a bit."</p><p>Snape glanced at Malfoy, who managed to look angry and shamefaced at the same time. "No wonder McGonagall was angry. I'll thank you not to manhandle my students in the future. I'll have to take this up with the Headmaster..."</p><p>"Will you? Will you indeed?" Moody rose in a surprisingly fluid motion for such a large man and advanced on Snape, staring him straight in the face. Snape backed a step and glanced to the side to avoid eye contact. "Wouldn't it be better to accept that as punishment in lieu of detention and let it go at that? We wouldn't want a confrontation between you and me and Dumbledore, would we, Cursemaster?"</p><p>It was Rabastan Lestrange's old nickname for Snape from their school days. <em>How does Moody know that? Rabastan's in Azkaban. Maybe he's told them other things about me. I don't know how much Moody knows.</em></p><p>Snape looked away from Moody toward Malfoy. "Are you all right, Draco?" he asked. The boy nodded. "Go back to Slytherin house, then, or to dinner if you're feeling well enough. I'll call for you if I need you further. 'Professor' Moody has said there's no detention."</p><p>"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir." Malfoy escaped from the office without a word of protest.</p><p>"That's better," said Moody once Malfoy was gone. "I got what I needed from him anyway. Sit down."</p><p>"You don't order me around in my own office."</p><p>"No? We can change. A nice little cell in Azkaban with a dementor or two. You'll be jumping to obey my orders like a trained dog. I'll come out of retirement just for the pleasure of holding your leash."</p><p>As he talked, Moody advanced and Snape retreated until Snape was backed against the counter work station. "Dumbledore... spoke for me..." Snape said, too nervous to notice that his childhood stutter was returning.</p><p>"I believe he did. Something about..." Moody leaned forward, breathing in Snape's face and gripping Snape's jaw with a hand, forcing brief eye contact. "Something about changing sides... about selling out your old master... Well, Dumbledore has a trusting heart. Not like me. You're a cagy old leopard, Snape, and I don't see any change in your spots. Just a bit of camouflage."</p><p>Releasing Snape, Moody strode quickly over to the door, opened it, and turned back with a twisted smile. "I got what I needed here, too. I'm going to enjoy teaching at Hogwarts, Snape. I may ask Dumbledore to extend my contract. Then you and I can share loads of good times." Laughing, he left the office, closing the door behind him.</p><p><em>Where did I ever get the idea all these years that Moody might be a decent human being? I let him fool me with a few minutes of cheerful banter once a year, but it was all sham. He's as black hearted as the worst of them, and he's not going to rest until I'm in Azkaban for good. I have to talk to Dumbledore about this. That man is dangerous.</em></p><p>Snape sat at his desk for a moment, his head in his hands, collecting his thoughts and calming his nerves. <em>I have to go to dinner. I have to face him at dinner and let him know I'm not cowed by his threats. He'll know anyway because I can't look at him. But I won't run. Besides, if I'm not there, Hagrid will ask, and Moody will joke about it, and everyone will know.</em> Snape left his office and reached the Great Hall while the last of the students were filtering in for dinner.</p><p>Pausing first to exchange pleasantries with Flitwick and Sprout, Snape eased into his seat between Sinistra and Moody. Moody seemed surprised to see him, Snape thought with some satisfaction. <em>He really was trying to scare me away. He said he'd gotten what he needed. I wonder what his game is.</em></p><p>The two didn't talk over dinner. Snape chatted with Sinistra, and Moody with Dumbledore. When Dumbledore left the table for a moment to speak to Filch, however, Moody began to rumble a low song, clearly meant only for Snape's ears.</p><p><em>Oh the walls of Azkaban</em></p><p><em>Are too high for any man,</em></p><p><em>And the servants of the Dark Lord shut up there</em></p><p><em>Wail and whimper through the night,</em></p><p><em>Quail and cower in their fright,</em></p><p><em>While dementors leave them twisted with despair.</em></p><p><em>But the Dark Lord's greatest slave,</em></p><p><em>A cunning, sly old knave</em></p><p><em>And one of those who managed to escape</em></p><p><em>Sits at Dumbledore's right hand</em></p><p><em>And obeys his least command -</em></p><p><em>The skinny black-eyed stooge, Professor...</em></p><p>"You might at least find something that's decent poetry," snapped Snape, and Moody broke off his doggerel to laugh.</p><p>"It was the best I could do on the spur of the moment. Catchy tune, though. I'd bet the students could pick it up like a shot if I was to start teaching it."</p><p>Snape pretended to be interested in his food, but Moody was not to be put off now that conversation had started.</p><p>"It's the lot of you that never had to pay that riles me. Said they never really did anything, or claimed to be under Imperius curses, or turned on their mates and sold them to the Ministry to cover their own deeds. That's what riles me. Got more respect for the ones that stayed loyal and took their punishment like men instead of finding the nearest rock to crawl under and hide like sniveling cowards."</p><p>Snape moved to rise, but Moody laid a hand on his arm to restrain him. "Do you want the whole school to know I can get under your skin any time I want to, and that you'll run from me when I do? Didn't you come out here to dinner just to show me that you weren't going to run? Sit. Keep me company."</p><p>Snape sat. Like a trained dog. Dumbledore returned as well, so Moody was distracted for the rest of the meal. When dinner ended, Snape retreated to his rooms, there to brood over the snare he found himself trapped in.</p><p>From that day on, Snape was in a foul mood that exploded into rage or vicious sarcasm at the slightest provocation. Every meal next to Moody was torment, and even patrolling the corridors was an exercise in dread because he never knew where he might run into Moody. Snape asked to speak to Dumbledore, but Dumbledore was occupied with planning the upcoming Tournament, and busy with the Ministry and the two other schools. He requested, if it was not urgent, that Snape wait until the following week.</p><p>The first Potions class with the fourth years went more smoothly than usual, probably because Malfoy was still suffering the ill effects of being a ferret and therefore abnormally quiet. Snape actually had the temerity to dare believe the session would end without any problems until Longbottom, perennially incompetent Longbottom, managed to melt his sixth cauldron in just over three years, sending across the floor a viscous, evil-smelling ooze that was supposed to remove warts if done properly, but since it had been prepared by Longbottom...</p><p>Students jumped onto chairs and tables in panic, several other cauldrons were in danger of overturning, and Snape was yelling at the cowering Longbottom. "You blithering fool! Where does it say newt's tongue? I didn't even set out newt's tongue! You had to make a special trip to a cabinet to get newt's tongue! You will stay during dinner on detention!"</p><p>Which turned out to serve two purposes, since Snape now had an excuse not to go to dinner and sit next to Moody.</p><p>Snape's next morning class needed horned toad intestines, so Snape gave Longbottom the task of disemboweling a cask of pickled horned toads to save the other students the time. Longbottom was so nervous that he made a horrible mess. <em>Too bad you can't dress me in your grandmother's clothes and say 'Ridikulus.'</em></p><p>That was when Snape realized that Longbottom's fear could help save his own life. An image of a frightened auror's child to show the Dark Lord. <em>Not a situation I would've created for that purpose, but since I have it, why not use it?</em></p><p>"He hates me." It was the next week, and Snape was in Dumbledore's office where the headmaster finally had some time to spare. "He called me a sniveling little coward and said Hogwarts was a rock I crawled under to hide."</p><p>"Sniveling? Interesting choice of words." Dumbledore was brewing a pot of tea.</p><p>"I don't think it was intentional. He wasn't at school with us." Snape drummed nervously with his fingers on the arm of the chair. "He wants me punished. He keeps talking about what it's going to be like in Azkaban. And he can read me."</p><p>There was no response, but Dumbledore paused in his preparations and waited.</p><p>"It's that enchanted eye. He can tell that I'm concealing things from him. He can't see the hidden thoughts, but he knows they're there. He knows when I'm lying."</p><p>"That is disturbing news. Do you think Riddle would employ such a device?"</p><p>"The old Riddle - no. But it's been thirteen years. Who knows?"</p><p>"How are you planning to handle it?"</p><p>"Compartmentalizing. I have a whole section just for you. Another on students and so forth. If Riddle sees I'm hiding things, but he thinks I'm doing it to conceal them from you, I may get away with it."</p><p>"And if you don't?"</p><p>"I don't want to think about it." Snape studied his hands, then went back to the drumming. "I mean, no one ever left him. After he was gone, of course, it was every man for himself, but no one ever left him while he was in power."</p><p>"Except..."</p><p>"Me."</p><p>"I shall tell Moody to ease up a bit. You have quite enough to worry about without having to deal with him, too." Dumbledore handed Snape a cup of tea, and Snape sipped it absentmindedly while staring into the fire.</p><p>Word filtered out through the students that Moody was demonstrating the Unforgivable Curses to fourth years and above. Snape went again to Dumbledore, who confirmed that it was on his instructions and with his full consent. The reasoning was sound, but it nonetheless resulted in Snape's overhearing some rather disturbing conversations.</p><p>"Whoa, did you see how that spider's legs just collapsed under and it kept just twitching and twitching on its back?"</p><p>"I didn't know a spider could twist its legs like that. I thought it was going to tie them into knots."</p><p>"Do spiders scream, do you think? I bet if that was a person..."</p><p>Having watched people being tortured by the Dark Lord with the Cruciatus curse, Snape could have confirmed some of the students' speculations, but he really did not want to think about it.</p><p>And so September melted into October. Snape had his fourth year students researching the antidotes to various poisons. This class had been, from the beginning, one of the least competent he'd ever taught. About the middle of October, however, Snape found a way to get them to study harder.</p><p>"You never know, Weasley, when an antidote may prove useful. I mean, it would be a shame to miss the Christmas break just for the want of a good, effective antidote."</p><p>"C-Christmas break, sir?"</p><p>"Well, maybe not you. Maybe Longbottom, or Finnegan. Or Potter. You never know who you may be called upon to assist in an emergency. I wouldn't worry over much, though. A good student could learn enough by then to deal with just about anything. You never know."</p><p>"No, sir. I guess you don't."</p><p>Madam Pince in the library said she'd seldom seen students knuckle down and work so diligently on a subject.</p><p>And Dumbledore was true to his word about talking to Moody. For a while Moody stopped trying to intimidate Snape. Things were looking up.</p><p>At the end of October, the representatives from the other two schools arrived to start the Triwizard Tournament.</p><p>One of the surprises of the whole Triwizard affair was that Dumbledore asked Snape to be involved in the administration of the tournament.</p><p>"Why me? I hate competitions. I'm hardly the congenial sort to make people feel welcome. None of the other houses will welcome Slytherin being in a position above them..."</p><p>"But consider, Severus, who else could it be? Minerva and I are already involved. Surely you do not want the Tournament supervised by Professor Trelawney? Or Professor Binns?"</p><p>"What about Sprout or Flitwick? Or... or..."</p><p>"Hagrid? He would want to turn the challenges into pets. Sinistra? She would be up all night and asleep during the competitions. Hooch? An excellent coach, but hardly an administrator on a grand scale. You must face facts, Severus, we are short of talent in this area. You are not only organized, but you have that wonderful muggle sense of practicality that purebloods never seem to master."</p><p>"In other words, I have no choice."</p><p>"Not a shred. There is an added attraction. An old... colleague of yours is heading the Durmstrang delegation."</p><p>"The only old 'colleagues' I have are..."</p><p>"Igor Karkaroff."</p><p>"Joy unbounded. The knell is sounded of grief and woe."</p><p>"Ah, the advantages of a classical education. Rogers and Hart?"</p><p>"Gilbert and Sullivan."</p><p>"There you have it. Back to Karkaroff. I thought you might want to discuss any recent phenomena he may be noticing. Easier if there is a reason why you two have to be together."</p><p>"Understood, sir. Try to keep Moody away from us."</p><p>"Thank you, Severus."</p><p>Luckily, none of Snape's duties involved preparing the castle itself. That was one of the advantages of having a hundred house-elves managing the household. Windows were washed, and walls and floors scrubbed. Armor was polished and tapestries beaten. Hearths were swept out and new wood laid, and sections of the fifth and sixth floors were made into temporary dormitories for the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students, dormitories with stunning views of the lake and hills.</p><p>On the thirtieth of October, Snape was, for once, quite relaxed. He'd had the distinct pleasure of being able to dismiss his dreaded fourth year potions class a half hour early, and none of the evening's festivities were his responsibility. He had only to shepherd Karkaroff around and sit next to him at dinner. But since Dumbledore was on Karkaroff's other side, Snape knew that little of the chore of conversation would fall to him.</p><p>At six o'clock in the evening, everything was ready. The four houses lined up in their hundreds to welcome the guests, with the four heads at Dumbledore's side. It was expected that the two continental wizarding schools would try to make a dramatic entrance, and they did not disappoint.</p><p>Beauxbatons arrived first, an enormous pale blue carriage pulled by a dozen great winged steeds came swooping over the treetops of the Forbidden Forest. It landed on the lawn in front of the entrance stairs, and Dumbledore welcomed the majestic Madame Maxime and her twelve boys and girls from what clearly must have been sunny France, for all were lightly dressed in silk, and shivered in the cold highland autumn of northern Scotland. <em>Note to self: Get the house-elves to sew up some warm cloaks. Fashionable warm cloaks in... royal blue.</em></p><p>Durmstrang arrived by boat, its great pirate hulk rising from a submarine passage under the lake, and docking at the foot of Hogwarts hill. These students, all boys, were warmly dressed in fur cloaks, obviously used to northern climes. At their head came a tall thin wizard with sleek silver hair and a goatee. As he greeted Dumbledore, Snape assessed him from his own place a little to the rear.</p><p><em>Hardly changed at all, I would say. Probably still far more concerned with himself and his own welfare than with the school. Bit more of a dandy than before. How has your arm been feeling lately, Igor? I hear a good number of our former comrades are in Azkaban because of you. I'd have been one of them if not for Dumbledore. You gave my name to the Ministry, too, I heard. No hard feelings, of course, since I'd already sold you out.</em></p><p>Then one more flurry of true excitement rustled through the Hogwarts students as the Durmstrang delegation entered the school. With Karkaroff, a student among other students, was a hefty, coarse-looking young man who drew everyone's attention.</p><p>"Who's that?" Snape asked McGonagall.</p><p>"You are hopeless! That's Bulgaria's Seeker. That's Viktor Krum."</p><p>The students were now filing into the school and the Great Hall for the welcoming feast. The Hogwarts teachers would follow, and then Dumbledore with his guests. Dumbledore called McGonagall and Snape over as the others were straightening out the order of their entrance.</p><p>"Madame Maxime, Professor Karkaroff, I should like to present the Deputy Headmistress, Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor house, and our potions master, Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house, who will be assisting her in making your stay enjoyable."</p><p>"Enchantée, delighted," they replied, and Karkaroff bent to kiss McGonagall's fingertips, then shook Snape's hand.</p><p>"I didn't realize you were here," Karkaroff muttered. "I'm glad of it, though. There's something I'd like to talk over with you when we have a private moment."</p><p>"I'm at your disposal," Snape answered, equally quietly.</p><p>Dumbledore spoke, and their attention shifted to him. "Minerva, Severus, there has been a slight change of plans. We shall be adding two places at the high table as we shall be joined by Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman, representing the Ministry. Mr. Crouch will be seated between Madam Maxime and Professor McGonagall, and Mr. Bagman between Professor Karkaroff and Professor Snape."</p><p><em>And Moody will be salivating in a corner. Three former Death Eaters in a row, all out of his reach.</em></p><p>"I do hope that arrangement is acceptable, Minerva - Severus."</p><p>"Oh, eminently, Headmaster," Snape replied. <em>So much better being next to Bagman than Crouch. Think how awkward it would be to place two avoiders of Azkaban on either side of someone who let his own son die there. Real conversation killer, that combination.</em></p><p>Karkaroff intruded on Snape's thoughts. "Which is your house? Green and silver it seems."</p><p>"Yes, Slytherin is green and silver, with the serpent."</p><p>Karkaroff turned and spoke briefly with one of his own students, then returned to Snape. "I've told them to sit with Slytherin house. If our students are friendly, we have more reason to talk without alerting suspicion."</p><p>"Excellent idea," said Snape, then took his place in the opening procession.</p><p>With the students all in place, the teachers entered two by two, those on the outside of the high table first, and the center group last. Snape noted that the Durmstrang students had joined Slytherin while the Beauxbatons students chose Ravenclaw. <em>Probably because Ravenclaw's color is blue.</em> Snape took his place at his own chair, leaving two places between himself and Dumbledore's center seat. Karkaroff left an empty seat between them. Snape noted that the Beauxbatons students stood at the entrance of Madame Maxime, and did not resume their seats until their headmistress was seated. <em>A little continental formality wouldn't hurt Hogwarts at all. Quite refreshing, really.</em></p><p>Dumbledore made no formal speech of welcome, merely expressing his wish that the guests be comfortable and announcing the beginning of the tournament at the end of the feast. Then all were seated and the feast began.</p><p>The menu selection was wonderful. Escargot a la Bourguignon, paté de foie gras, bouillabaisse, and a risotto with truffles. Zakuski, Polish borscht, chicken Kiev, and a real Stroganov on straw potatoes. <em>We need to do this at least once a year just for the food!</em></p><p>A minor spot of activity around the Gryffindor table attracted Snape's attention. One of the Beauxbatons students had risen and seemed to be interested in a tureen on the Gryffindor table. Snape glanced at her, looked away, glanced back, and was riveted.</p><p>The first thought that entered his head was 'Narcissa.' This vision of silver and blue was his snow-queen, the ice princess who'd captured his thirteen-year-old heart in the Black's London townhouse so many years ago.</p><p>Only a few moments later did Snape realize he was staring practically openmouthed at the girl, and a glance around told him he was not the only one. Nearly every male in the Great Hall, except Dumbledore, had the same stupid, dumbfounded expression that Snape knew was on his own face. He leaned across the empty seat towards Karkaroff.</p><p>"What is she?" Snape whispered.</p><p>"A veela," was Karkaroff's response.</p><p><em>Oh. Well. That - explains everything. You've gone all... weak in the knees because of some... highly evolved, pheromone-producing, mutant - glorious goddess. Nothing at all to be concerned about in that. Except she's a student. - Out of bounds. Students are out of bounds. Even Madame Maxime's gorgeous veela students are... out of... bounds...</em></p><p>Fortunately, Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman chose that moment to enter the Great Hall and be seated, thereby distracting Snape from a highly... moving... experience.</p><p>Ludo Bagman was the stereotype of a former athlete gone to seed. He was paunchy and out of shape, yet seemed to think that if he dressed like a young man, no one would notice. His tight clothing and loud style merely underlined his rotundity, which would not have been so bad if his mind had reflected his chronological instead of his emotional age. As it was, dinner conversation with Ludo Bagman was about the most boring experience of Snape's life.</p><p>Snape tried to enliven the evening by imagining Moody's face as he watched the three together. It was a sore disappointment that the one time Snape actually wanted to look at Moody, Moody was down the table to Snape's right, and looking at him would be far too obvious.</p><p>Still, the thought of the three of them together must be galling Moody. Karkaroff spent some time in Azkaban, but not for want of trying. He'd spilled every name he could think of to the Wizards' Council, and it was just his bad luck that they'd all been captured or killed. <em>Except me, but I'd already been handed to Dumbledore on good behavior. Poor Karkaroff, not one decent name left to buy his freedom with. Wonder what Moody thinks of him. Took his punishment, but not like a man. He was searching desperately for that rock.</em></p><p>Bagman had supplied information to the Death Eaters, but had never been one. His plea of ignorance and stupidity had been accepted without murmur by the Council, since he had long had the reputation of being both ignorant and stupid, and no one really expected him to understand the politics of the situation. <em>But does Moody accept that too obvious defense? Is there a possibility that Bagman isn't as dumb as we think he is?</em></p><p><em>And then there's me. How would Moody take it, I wonder, if I sat down with him and told him about needing Bella's protection in school, and Nana's death, and that idiot Trelawney's prophecy, and Lily? Or if I described the powerful intensity of existence, walking into Headquarters knowing I'd already drawn up my own death warrant, and living on a razor's edge for love of something I could finally believe in? No, he'd never accept that story. It doesn't fit into his world view.</em></p><p>The conversation had turned to the upcoming Triwizard Tournament, and Bagman was explaining the rules. Snape became suddenly interested at learning that only wizards of legal age would be allowed to compete.</p><p><em>Well, well. For once precious Potter will not be the center of everyone's attention. Three other people will come first in the public eye by right. Wonder how he'll take it. Will he just accept it and take a back seat to the school champions, or will he try to do something that'll make everyone pay attention to him? Fake a kidnapping, for example, or introduce another troll into the dungeons. I'm actually interested in seeing how he reacts.</em></p><p>Then the feasting was over, and Dumbledore rose to explain the conditions of the tournament. It said something about the Hogwarts students that there was widespread disapproval of the age limitation. Snape was particularly amused at the passions aroused by the announcement. <em>If the Sorting Hat had witnessed the level of ambition expressed in this hall tonight, every one of the them would have been placed in Slytherin house. Imagine me being head of house for Fred or George Weasley. The mind boggles.</em></p><p>In the end, Potter was not to be denied. Despite being on the other side of the Hall, he managed to place himself strategically in the path of the Durmstrang students as they made their way out to their dormitories. With Potter's hair swept aside to reveal the lightning-shaped scar, it was impossible for Karkaroff not to notice him. Karkaroff stopped, pointed Potter out to all the Durmstrang students, and Potter again had his moment of fame.</p><p><em>Some day someone is going to shoot that boy down, and the crash of his landing will be glorious.</em></p><p>Potter's glory was short-lived, however, for Moody, unable to contain himself, intervened to intimidate Karkaroff. <em>That man is obsessed. This is going far beyond what would be required of an auror. Dumbledore has got to rein him in.</em></p><p>The next day was highly entertaining. First of all the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students, all of whom were of age, placed their names into the judging goblet with great dignity and sense of history. A few of the Hogwarts students did the same, but for the remainder it was a free-for-all. Snape heard about it and started inventing excuses to be in the Great Hall just to watch. He was there for the hilarious debacle of the Weasley twins, which in and of itself made the entire semester.</p><p>Snape also stored up as ammunition for later the fact that most of the would-be cheaters were Gryffindor students. The other houses, particularly Slytherin, seemed more willing to accept and abide by the rules. Snape was not going to let McGonagall forget this for a long time.</p><p>Hour by hour and minute by minute the clock ticked down to supper time and the moment when the enchanted goblet would announce the school champions, the competitors in the Triwizard Tournament. For once, even Snape was excited.</p><p>The Great Hall was decorated in its usual Halloween finery for the feast and the selection of champions. Snape entered a bit early to be sure everything was going well. The Goblet of Fire, the magical cup that chose the champions, was in front of Dumbledore's place, having received the names of all the qualified students who wished to enter the competition.</p><p>"Who do you think it will be from your school?" said Karkaroff's voice behind him, and Snape turned.</p><p>"Good evening, Igor," Snape replied. "I haven't a clue. I'm not even certain who's put their name in. Who'll it be from your school?"</p><p>"We are all expecting Krum to be chosen, but one never knows." There was a moment of silence, then Karkaroff cleared his throat. "Severus, have you noticed anything... different... recently?"</p><p>"Different?" said Snape innocently. "Why, what do you mean?"</p><p>"A sense of... constant irritation. An itching."</p><p>It would be disingenuous to pretend he didn't know what Karkaroff was talking about. "Yes. It started in the middle of August."</p><p>"Mine as well. Do you think...? What do you think it means?"</p><p>"Have you heard that he's come back?"</p><p>"We got a rumor to that effect. I was not sure if it was true."</p><p>"It was true. He - or what's left of him - was here at Hogwarts two years ago. He was inhabiting another teacher. I sat next to him without realizing it."</p><p>Karkaroff stared at Snape with horror and pity. "How awful for you! What do you think he knows now?"</p><p>"I'm not sure. I can't remember every conversation I ever had with that professor, after all. With luck, it was all noncommittal or ambiguous. Quirrell and I weren't friends, luckily. Hardly even friendly." He looked at the nervous expression on Karkaroff's face. "Don't worry. I am sure that I never once mentioned or even thought about you."</p><p>Maybe Karkaroff really did miss the sarcasm in Snape's voice because he seemed relieved. "Look, we are almost ready. The tables are full. But who in the world is that?"</p><p>Snape looked, then looked quickly away, trying to control the expression on his face. Madame Maxime had just entered the Great Hall accompanied by Hagrid. But it was not a Hagrid that Snape would have recognized by anything except size, for this Hagrid was wearing a suit and tie, and had slicked his hair down with grease. Most British wizards had alarming senses of style, and Hagrid was no exception, looking like a sore thumb next to the fashionable Madame Maxime.</p><p>Then Dumbledore entered with Crouch and Bagman, and all took their places for the feast.</p><p>Two feasts in two days was a lot of food. Snape had nowhere near the appetite this Halloween that he'd had the evening before. He was not alone. Whether it was too much of a good thing, or everyone was too excited about the naming of the contestants to be hungry, the feast was over in relatively short order. In front of Dumbledore, the Goblet prepared its selections.</p><p>Dumbledore rose just before the fateful moment to instruct the named contestants to proceed directly to a room off the high end of the Great Hall, and then with dramatic flair extinguished all but the jack o' lanterns to highlight the blue fire of the Goblet.</p><p>The Goblet's flames turned red and it sent a piece of parchment spinning into the air. Dumbledore caught it and read, "Viktor Krum!" As this was no surprise to anyone, the applause was hearty and affectionate.</p><p>The second piece of parchment flew into the air, and Dumbledore read, "Fleur Delacour!" This, apparently, was a surprise, for several Beauxbatons students were clearly disappointed in the Goblet's choice. Snape noted that the student in question was the veela girl, and also noted that with the element of the unexpected gone, she had less effect on himself and the other males than she'd had the evening before. <em>Thank goodness.</em></p><p>Then it was Hogwarts' turn, and the Hufflepuff table went wild when Cedric Diggory's name was called. The other tables were less enthusiastic, but that was only to be expected. Snape leaned back, looked down the teachers' table, and gave Professor Sprout a 'thumb's up.' It was, after all, about time that Hufflepuff was in the limelight.</p><p>As one of the school administrators of the Tournament, Snape was supposed to go with the contestants and their school heads, so he rose to follow Diggory into the side room. It was then that the Goblet turned red again and tossed up a fourth name.</p><p><em>That's impossible! There can only be one contestant per school.</em> The entire Hall was silent as a clearly shocked Dumbledore stared at the piece of parchment. Then, in a strange, hesitant voice, he read, "Harry Potter."</p><p>Astoundingly, Potter didn't seem to want to join the others in the side room. He sat stubbornly at the Gryffindor table shaking his head as his house mates plied him with questions. But Snape couldn't think about Potter for long because a quite different situation was nearing critical at his side.</p><p>"What kind of base trickery is this?" growled Karkaroff next to him. "Does Dumbledore take me for a fool?"</p><p>At exactly the same moment, the mark on Snape's arm gave him a sudden twinge. Snape looked around in surprise, but no one was watching him except Moody. If Karkaroff's arm had felt the same twinge, Karkaroff did not seem to notice. He was too upset.</p><p>Small as it was, however, the twinge brought a remarkable clarity of purpose to Snape. Any thought he might have remotely entertained about solving mysteries, or about truth, justice, or fair play, vanished immediately.</p><p>The only thing in his mind was the image of Karkaroff kneeling to the Dark Lord. <em>And when you cower there before him, your soul naked and exposed, and your mind spread open like a gutted fish, what will you show him of me? So whom now do I support? What course the least likely to enrage the Dark Lord?</em></p><p>"It can't be Dumbledore," Snape said soothingly to Karkaroff. "His reputation is too much on the line. He wouldn't do anything to damage that. It's the Potter boy who's responsible. He must have gotten someone else to put his name into the Goblet. He wants everyone to notice him. It's been like that since the first day he came to this school."</p><p>Karkaroff didn't answer. He was on his feet and trying to get Dumbledore's attention even as Potter, on the Headmaster's orders, came up the aisle and went into the side room. Snape kept trying to deflect Karkaroff away from Dumbledore, especially here in public. "Igor, it can't be his fault. He has nothing to gain by such a transparent ploy. It has to be Potter's doing."</p><p>Then they were in the side room with the - could it be possible - four champions. Everyone wanted to talk at once.</p><p>"Madame Maxime! Zey are saying zat zis little boy..."</p><p>"What is ze meaning of zis, Dumbly-dore?"</p><p>"Two Hogwarts champions? I don't remember anyone telling me the host school..."</p><p>"'Ogwarts cannot 'ave two champions!"</p><p>"We were under the impression that your Age Line would keep out..."</p><p>Snape tried to catch Karkaroff's attention. "It's no one's fault but Potter's. Don't go blaming Dumbledore for Potter's determination to break rules. He has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here..."</p><p>"Thank you, Severus," said Dumbledore suddenly, and Snape was as suddenly quiet. <em>Resentment. I resent his slapping me down, the meddling old fool. Remember that feeling.</em></p><p>Dumbledore began questioning Potter, and Snape allowed himself several vocal expressions of disbelief, including sighs and one soft snort. He could tell that Dumbledore was not pleased, but he'd explain later. <em>Besides, isn't it obvious that Potter really is concealing something?</em></p><p>McGonagall was beside herself. The concept that a Gryffindor student might cheat at sports was so counterintuitive to her that the mere suggestion of it threatened her very sense of self worth. <em>Odd that the thought that one might cheat academically does not have quite the same effect.</em></p><p>"Really," she sputtered, "what nonsense! Harry could not... and as Professor Dumbledore believes... I'm sure that should be good enough for everybody else!" Snape could tell from her glare that the two of them were on the outs again.</p><p>Karkaroff appealed to Bagman, who reluctantly confirmed that whomever the Goblet named was bound to compete. Since the Goblet had gone out, not to be ignited again until the next tournament, the ranting and raving of the principles was irrelevant. They had four champions, and that was it.</p><p>At this pronouncement, Karkaroff was livid. "I have half a mind to leave now!" he exclaimed, only to be stopped by a new, lionine voice.</p><p>"Empty threat, Karkaroff! You can't leave your champion now. He's got to compete. They've all got to compete. Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient, eh?" It was Moody, who'd pushed his way into the room.</p><p>Then Moody, amid protests from Madame Maxime and Karkaroff, advanced the theory that Potter's name had been submitted by someone who wanted Potter dead.</p><p>And that was when Snape began to quietly panic. He could feel - feel! the blood drain from his face, and his joints tense with the need to run. <em>For the only one he knew who would want Potter dead was the Dark Lord, and this meant a servant of the Dark Lord was in the castle.</em></p><p>And Snape didn't know who he was.</p><p>Madame Maxime and Karkaroff continued to protest, but to no avail. A student whose name came out of the Goblet had to compete, and that was that. Taking Miss Delacour and Krum, they left the room, still offended by the evening's events. Ludo Bagman announced that he was staying at Hogwarts for the whole tournament, while Mr. Crouch bade everyone goodbye and returned to his duties at the Ministry. They exited the chamber together, leaving Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, and Moody.</p><p>McGonagall looked over at Dumbledore. "You don't really think someone will try to kill Potter, do you?"</p><p>"It's the only explanation that fits." Moody laughed, the only person Snape had ever heard who could make a laugh sound sour. "You could tell from the boy's face he wasn't expecting it, didn't want it, and would like to be rid of it."</p><p>"There," McGonagall said to Snape. "No student could have done that by himself. Potter was the victim. Moody understands the situation. You might try adopting some of his viewpoints."</p><p>"Are you honestly telling me that you would support Malfoy if his name came out of the hat?"</p><p>McGonagall's furious glare was priceless, and Snape immediately filed it with the other images of bad relations with the rest of the staff. <em>Stay a few minutes longer, and I can get several more.</em></p><p>Dumbledore, however, was ready to break up the meeting. "Severus, I should like to speak with you for a few minutes in my office. Minerva, Alastor, it has been a long, tiring evening. I suggest we all turn in for the night. Tomorrow will be another exciting day."</p><p>The look on Moody's face as he watched Snape follow Dumbledore out of the room was not calculated to make Snape feel comfortable.</p><p>In his office, Dumbledore poured them both a glass of mead, and they settled into the comfortable chairs in front of the fire.</p><p>"One of these days," Snape said reflectively, "our glaring contradictions are going to catch up to us and we'll have to pay. You are lucky, you know, that it's the Dursleys."</p><p>"Come again?"</p><p>"Think of the inconsistency. We insist on the signed permission of a parent or guardian to let Potter go on a school sponsored outing to Hogsmeade, but we require him to compete in a life-threatening tournament, also school sponsored, without even notifying the same parent or guardian of its existence. Granted the Dursleys don't care what happens to Potter, but it might occur to them that they could sue you. I would. Wrongful death, or loss of affection. Could be worth a lot of money."</p><p>"Am I to take it, then, that after you retire from teaching Potions you are planning on becoming legal counsel to Hogwarts parents?"</p><p>"Think how rich I could be! Here I am killing myself trying to cope with hundreds of hormone crazy preteens and adolescents, when I could be living on the proceeds of a few lucrative cases. Think of life without homework!"</p><p>"Uh-hem. I had been intending to talk about Karkaroff."</p><p>"Oh, right. I just got caught up in the moment there. Karkaroff's been feeling the same thing I have. His mark's been itching, too. It started at the same time. I am presuming that every single one of us has felt it. It may be one of the things that inspired the unfortunate 'demonstration' at the Quidditch World Cup. I mean, they all felt that the Dark Lord is coming back."</p><p>"I am equally concerned that Alastor is correct, that someone is using the Triwizard Tournament to kill Potter. Maybe as a result of knowing that... Riddle... is coming back."</p><p>"Who? Tell me that. Who? Because I've been trying to think of an answer ever since Moody proposed the idea. It had to be someone in the castle in the last twenty-four hours. We know everyone who was here. Which of them are you suggesting is the one?"</p><p>"We do not know everyone who might have been here. Just last year we found that we had harbored three unregistered animagi for several years. For all we know, someone has slipped in that we would never recognize as an agent."</p><p>"Problem with that idea. This required a powerful spell to confuse the Goblet. I agree with Moody on that. Someone coming in as an animagus wouldn't be able to use a wand without transforming, and the Goblet was being watched. I don't know any - maybe one or two - wizards who could do that kind of magic wandless."</p><p>"Do you prefer the idea that someone, someone we know, in the castle is a strong supporter of Riddle?"</p><p>Snape looked bleakly up at Dumbledore. "I can't ever let down my guard, can I?"</p><p>The tension in the school was palpable. Gryffindor was strongly behind Potter, but despite all McGonagall's efforts, none of the other houses would support him. Snape was, in spite of all his other worries, ecstatic.</p><p><em>It wasn't just that it was us. It was that we were the winners! While Slytherin was winning, the rest of the school would support anyone trying to bring us down. Now that Gryffindor is ahead, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw resent their ascendancy, too. The world is an orderly and predictable place, and more fair than I had been daring to imagine.</em></p><p>Much of the animosity was directed against Potter personally. This was not unexpected, given the number of times he'd been allowed to be the hero. It was a form of comeuppance. Despite the clear unfairness of this shift in public opinion, Snape was not at all averse to taking advantage of it. After all, there were more important things at stake, and any image he had of disliking Potter, or vice versa, would shield Snape from some of the Dark Lord's wrath.</p><p>It was nearly two weeks later when another opportunity presented itself</p><p>That day, Snape did not join the other teachers for lunch. He had a problem to sort out and plan for, and needed some extended quiet time in his own office.</p><p>The problem was Potter. Or rather, the problem was how to explain Potter to the Dark Lord, for an explanation would be demanded. <em>If I live that long.</em></p><p><em>Thank goodness I don't like the boy and he doesn't like me. There's nothing I have to hide, and no false situations I have to create. Just plenty of good, honest images and emotions, except...</em> The exception was the time Snape had prevented the Dark Lord from killing Potter.</p><p><em>Luckily, I didn't know at the time that the Dark Lord was involved. Unfortunately, at the time I didn't know it was Quirrell either. Just that it was very powerful dark magic. How do I explain taking action to prevent an event that would avenge my master's destruction? To keep in good standing with Dumbledore? But why, if I believed the Dark Lord to be dead? And how to explain not recognizing the source of the power behind that spell on Potter's broom?</em></p><p>The great bell sounding the beginning of afternoon classes rang throughout Hogwarts, and Snape was startled out of his reverie. <em>There'll be students already waiting in the corridor.</em> He quickly left his office for the classroom.</p><p>There was a sudden panicky scramble of students in Snape's path, a pause, and the unmistakable hiss and sparkle of spell casting. <em>A fight! In front of my classroom!</em> Snape pushed his way forward to find Malfoy and Potter both armed with wands, Goyle and Granger obviously victims of some spell, and pandemonium among the rest of the students. Intimidation was the only course of action.</p><p>"And what is all this noise about?" Snape said in a soft voice, more deadly than any yelling could be. Pointing at Malfoy, he ordered, "Explain."</p><p>"Potter attacked me, sir -"</p><p>Potter interrupted at full volume. "We attacked each other at the same time!" <em>He didn't accuse Malfoy of starting it. Potter must have pulled out his wand first.</em></p><p>"- and he hit Goyle - look -"</p><p>Snape examined Goyle. No real problem except that the boils on his face were ugly and probably itched. "Hospital wing, Goyle," he said quietly.</p><p>Then Weasley spoke up. "Malfoy got Hermione! Look!"</p><p>The poor girl had been hit by a tooth-growing spell. Her already large front teeth had grown to the point where she looked like a beaver. Snape opened his mouth to say 'Hospital wing' when the image of himself kneeling to the Dark Lord interposed. Without pausing to reflect, he said, "I see no difference," and as the shocked, tearful girl ran crying towards the entrance hall, both Potter and Weasley began yelling names at Snape that he was surprised two fourteen-year-olds would know.</p><p><em>Perfect. Pure hatred from both of you. It couldn't be better if I'd planned it.</em> "Let's see. Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley. Now get inside, or it'll be a week's worth of detentions." At no point had Snape raised his voice.</p><p>The students entered the room, which was when Snape noticed the 'POTTER STINKS' badges. He collected images while pretending not to notice. He was about to pull more anger from Potter when Creevey came into the class and informed him that Potter was needed for Tournament business. Snape had no choice but to let the boy go.</p><p><em>Do you see, Lord? Do you see how I favor the children of Death Eaters, and how I treat mudbloods, mongrels, and blood traitors? Please let him look at my evidence before...</em> But that was the part that Snape didn't want to think about.</p><p>The week before the first task of the Triwizard Tournament, Snape was in the Potions classroom, setting up for his first afternoon class before he went to lunch. Light from the corridor dimmed suddenly, and Snape looked up, then quickly down again. Moody stood framed in the doorway.</p><p>"Mind if I come in? Just for a chat."</p><p>"I'm on my way out," Snape replied, deciding to leave the rest of the setting up until after lunch. He moved quickly to the door, but Moody blocked his path.</p><p>"You shouldn't make it so obvious that you're trying to avoid me. It hurts my feelings. Then I get angry and lose my temper, and start bouncing things off the walls. Like ferrets, for example. You ever been a ferret, Snape?"</p><p>Snape bristled. "Are you another one that goes around shooting people in the back? Because that's the only way you're going to transform me into anything."</p><p>"You think I can't take you?"</p><p>"I know you can't take me. Not face to face."</p><p>"Then why are you scared of me?"</p><p>"There are things one is wise to be wary of. Rabid dogs, for instance."</p><p>Moody barked a loud laugh. "So now I'm 'Mad Dog' Moody! Well, sonny, watch your back. Someday I may decide to take you, and I always heed warnings. But that wasn't what I came about today."</p><p>"So you're going to let me leave my classroom now, right?"</p><p>"Chat first. Then you can go. You're helping administer this Tournament. I need to know if all the safeguards are in place for the first task."</p><p>Snape's antennae were out immediately. "Shouldn't you be asking that question of Professor Dumbledore?"</p><p>"Dumbledore has a lot on his plate now, so I'm asking you."</p><p>"You're asking the wrong person. I'm not involved in the tasks."</p><p>"They don't trust you with information, eh? Can't say as I blame them. I wouldn't trust you myself."</p><p>"I notice that you're the one asking the question. I guess they don't trust you either."</p><p>"Touchy, Snape. Touchy."</p><p>"I think you mean touché. Now if you have nothing else to pump me about, I'm going to lunch."</p><p>Moody stepped aside and allowed Snape to pass through the door, then accompanied him to the Great Hall for lunch, where the two sat next to each other through the meal without exchanging another word.</p><p>That weekend was the first Hogsmeade excursion for the third years and above, joined this time by the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students. Snape was one of the teachers assigned to supervise, and he managed to slip out the gate a good half hour ahead of the hordes so that he could find a small nook, preferably in a quiet corner of the Three Broomsticks, before things got too crowded. The table he chose was hidden from the door by part of the counter, and while Snape couldn't see the whole room from his table, neither could they see him. Which was, of course, the point.</p><p>Nothing, however, could hide Hagrid from anyone. When the gamekeeper's bulk crossed the threshold, Snape knew it. He huddled down closer to the table, hoping that even from his great height Hagrid wouldn't be able to see him over the counter. Snape was in no mood to talk, not even to Hagrid.</p><p>He needn't have worried. Hagrid wasn't alone. Behind him stumped Moody, and the two sat together in the middle of the room talking like old friends. Some of what they were discussing appeared to be confidential, for Hagrid bent his head down near to Moody's ear and was obviously whispering.</p><p><em>And you, Severus, are obviously spying. What difference does it make to you what Hagrid and Moody are talking about?</em> But curiosity was not to be denied, and Snape continued to watch.</p><p>The two rose after a while and went to another table where Granger was sitting by herself. <em>By herself? Must be Potter and his invisibility cloak. Maybe he doesn't want to deal with the teasing.</em> Moody bent down to talk to thin air, a jolting reminder to Snape that his enchanted eye wasn't fooled by magical tricks or items. <em>He can see through the cloak!</em> Then Moody and Hagrid left the Three Broomsticks.</p><p><em>Note to self.
